                <h2>School of Rock</h2>
                <img class="picfloatsmall" src="static/img/schoolofrock.jpg" alt="schoolofrock">
                <p>
                    It's 1 o'clock in the morning and I have work tomorrow but I had to finish watching school of rock and now I have to blog about it while it's still fresh in my mind.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It reminded me of when I was a teacher and how awesome and full of potential kids are.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you've been living under a rock, I'll tell you real quick what it's about before I analyze it.  It's about a guy who can't pay his rent because he's trying to make it in a band.  Dewey (jack black) lives with his brother and his brother's girlfriend is pressuring him to tell Dewey to get a job or move out.  Meanwhile, Dewey also gets kicked out of his own band.
                </p>
                <p>
                    His phone rings and he decides to pretend to be his brother who is a substitute teacher.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    Then he goes to teach at a prep elementary school and collect the money letting the kids do whatever.  But then, it stops being about the paycheck.  He sees the kids during their music class and sees their potential.  Then he get's all engaged as a teacher and his passion takes over.  Nothing is better than teaching a kid something for the first time that you're passionate about.  Bringing what you love to their attention and seeing them experience it for the first time is epic. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Then he starts this whole class project called "Rock Band".  He plans on entering Battle of the Bands with the class. I forgot to mention he put out fliers and no one wanted to join his band.  
                </p>

                <p>
                    Anyway, the whole time I'm thinking about the ethical implications of what he's doing.  Are the kids missing out on a real education by studying rock and roll everyday?  No, they aren't.  Is math worth learning?  Yes, but you don't need to study it everyday.  That makes it boring.  Engaging the kids with passion is all that really matters.  If kids are engaged, you can teach a months worth of math in one day.  It's when it's monotonous and boring when it becomes difficult to teach.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Also, the idea of him not being qualified to be in front of children and teach, it's ridiculous.  He's the perfect teacher.  He's so honest, and genuine.  He wants the kids to unlock their potential.  He loves them.  It's beautiful to watch, seriously.  Kids are robbed of people like that and people like that have to basically lie to get in front of kids and teach what they're passionate about.  I remember teaching a lego robotics class but I was very into math at the time and I would teach the kids secret math lessons way above their grade level and it got them super-engaged.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Children will rise to whatever expectations are placed on them, without fail.  If you tell them they're all going to be treated like college kids, they'll start acting like it.  It's remarkable.  I had half the class teaching itself.  I'd teach one kid one thing and have him master it and then each kid was a master of one skill and they all taught themselves it.  Teaching is the best way to understand something.  So, that was my golden teaching method.  I think it could be widespread and incredibly impactful, so I'll have to revisit it.  But imagine if during middle school you got to read ahead about geology, or whatever your favorite subject is, and then teach the class that one subject, or lesson.  you would be pro at it.  And then all the "teacher" has to do is make sure each kid is master of one thing.  Then they will all naturally be dying to explain their expertise to one another.  It's impossible to have 7 expert kids in a room without them all sharing ideas.  It really does work.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I know it's just a fictional movie but it's such a great story and I love love loved watching it. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Rock on.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Also, all my rules had caveats.  Like No cell phones, unless you can solve this math problem.  Then, go on your phone the rest of class, I don't care. do you know how frantically the kids try to learn math when you attach a reward like that?  They leapfrog 50 IQ points and 5 grade levels I'm not kidding.  You can teach a kid algebra in 30 minutes with that trick.
