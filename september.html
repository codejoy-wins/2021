                <h2>The Imperfect Date</h2>
                <p>
                    Fitting to receive bad news on 9/11.  Although, I had kind of seen it coming
                </p>
                <p>
                    This week I worked up the courage to ask a pretty girl out on a date.
                </p>
                <p>
                    She said yes! and we went to dinner, and we kissed!
                </p>
                <p>
                    The next day, she sent me a text letting me know it's not going to work.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Here is my response.  For some reason  I can't write anything down without posting it.  And I want her to see it.  She's 22 and I'm 29.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Hi L******,
                </p>
                <p>
I want to tell you the truth about me before I let you go.  I'm a lonely guy.  I'm turning 30.  My good friends I have left live in Santa Monica.  I've been alone for a year or two since I broke up with my last girlfriend because I knew she wasn't who I really wanted and I was just using her for sex.  I've been trying to be at peace with being alone, but a man needs a woman.
</p>
<p>
I really do believe in God.  I don't like when I sin by watching porn but I don't have a healthy sexual outlet.  I started asking girls out in person that I thought were pretty, but I would get rejected.  When I tried dating apps, it was usually even worse.  I wouldn't match with the types of girls I think would satisfy me.
</p>
<p>
After getting rejected one day in person in a humiliating way, I decided to try harder.  I cut my hair differently, I shaved my beard more often, I started going to the gym a little bit and eating a little healthier, and I made sure I had nice clothes on for the next time I had the courage to approach a pretty girl.
</p>
<p>
Then I saw you walking towards me as I was walking the dog, and I thought I might as well give it another try.  You said yes, which was a surprise.  Then we texted and went out to dinner.  The whole time texting I was honestly just trying to not screw up the opportunity.  Then when we had our date, I really enjoyed it and I went for the kiss at the end so I could make my intentions clear.  I thought it would be a peck, or that you'd reject it, but instead you surprised me yet again by making out with me with lots of tongue.  
</p>
<p>
I figured I'd get to see you again so I quit while I was ahead.  I never expected to get this far with a girl like you.  I've had pretty girlfriends before but not since college.
</p>
<p>
Another truth is, I was in the mental hospital twice about a couple years ago, after I couldn't get the job at google, I kind of broke down with the pressure of having to pay for my life without a high-paying job I thought I was going to get.  
</p>
<p>
My delusions were related to my belief in Jesus and conspiracy theories.  At my worst, I toyed with the idea that I was the second coming.  It took me a while to come back from that.  I was on meds and in treatment and got out of both.  I used to smoke a lot of marijuana which contributed to my psychosis.
</p>
<p>
Anyway, I'm just a person trying to make it on this Earth, and I'm really sensitive with pretty girls' opinions of me because when they don't like me I tend not to feel good about myself.  I doubt myself and I lose self-respect and self-confidence from jerking off to porn alone.
</p>
<p>
But I know I'd rather be alone than settle with someone I know I'll never be in love with.  I know it'd be easy to fall in love with you.  You have the qualities I'm looking for.  And maybe you really are too young.  The truth is I wasted a lot of my 20's getting high and wallowing in sorrow over my highschool sweetheart leaving me in college.  I actaully flunked out of UCSC and had severe social anxiety.  Then I worked my way back into school to get my degree and I got a new girlfriend but I didn't want to do long-distance again once I graduated and she wasn't perfect for me. 
</p>
<p>
Anyway,  what I'm really trying to do here is give you some context for when I say I'm not expecting to go from 0-100 real quick.  I know there's a lot of miles I need to run on the treadmill before I can attract a girl of your quality, and I'm not there yet.  I wanted to make my intentions clear, just in case I got lucky and you gave me a chance as your boyfriend.
</p>
<p>
But, what I really want, is just to spend time with you or a girl like you, and gain self-respect and self-confidence in the presense of true beauty, which I think you are.  Now, maybe I am too old to be your boyfriend.  I wasn't even going to officially ask you to me my girlfriend because I know that can put way too much pressure on a relationship between people who just met.  But am I too old to be your friend?  I wouldn't mind being your friend.  I could learn so much from you.  And I wasn't pretending to be interested in you to get in your pants.  I actually am interested in you.  And, if we were just hanging out as friends, I can live with that, because I've taken my best shot at this time.  I want to try again later, but maybe not.  I mean, maybe there is a better match for both of us, and that's okay.  But what I don't want is to never see you again, or hear from you again, or to be on your "bad" list.
</p>
<p>
I'm just a man, who tried to get to know a woman.  Does it really have to be boyfriend or bust?  Can't we just be friends?
</p>
<p>
I don't know if age is the only thing.  Maybe you didn't feel a spark when we kissed.  But did you look me up?  Did you look me up online and see that I don't get 200 likes on instagram like you do?  I did excel at social media when I was your age too, I just don't anymore.  And also, did you read my blog, and judge me?  I mean I understand the impulse, but I'd love to know.  Am I just sabatoging myself for any future jobs or girlfriends with my blog?  
</p>
<p>
I wish you could help me, as a friend, and teach me how to find and keep a girl like you, starting from where I am.
</p>
<p>
I'm so curious what I did wrong, and why you kissed me the way you did.   Or, if you'll change your mind, or if you would have if I had just played it cool.  But it's not cool.  It's not cool to have me spend that much money and effort to date you and then you just throw me away with a little text.  I mean, I don't know what it's like to be a girl and have to put someone down easy, but I honestly expected a little bit more from you.   I knew something was wrong when you weren't texting me anything after our date, but I thought when a girl french kisses me it means she likes me.  I guess not.  And then I'm thinking to myself should I have asked to make out with you more in your car, and if we had established more of physical connection, maybe that'd be harder to leave.  But I wanted to respect the whole traditional dating thing we talking about.
</p>
<p>
I don't know how you feel about sex before marriage but that'd be a potential issue down the road anyway because I'm not keen on getting married soon.  I have a long way to go financially before I can think about a wife and kids.
</p>
<p>
I felt terrible most of the day at work after I got your text.  Then I felt a little better after I sent how I felt about it.
</p>
<p>
I know you don't owe me anything.  I just really want to avoid the worst case scenario which is no pretty girls in my life.  Like, I wish we could see where this goes.  I really tried.  I really would have tried every single date until I made you mine.  And it seems my best effort wasn't good enough and that's fine.  I wouldn't date me if I were you.  Maybe I wouldn't be my freind either.
</p>
<p>
But I thought you were different from other girls.  I saw real kindness in you, and intelligence.  When you say, "everyone is losing their minds" over Covid, I'm not.  We could be sane together.  I'm unvaccinated, and I don't appreciate mandates.  I gather you are vaccinated, which I understand given your profession and status as a student.  
</p>
<p>
That's all I really have to say.  As you can see, I'm a mess.  I'm not expecting to hit a home run with a cheerleader with the first girl I asked out since I started trying after abandoning a mentality of giving up.  I'm not asking you to be my girlfriend.  I just want to know if you really didn't have any fun, and if there's anything I could have done better.  Obviously I was smooth enough to get the number the date and the kiss, but I just really need to improve in the whole no girlfriend thing.  I don't even have a bed right now in my room.  I'm not ready for a girlfriend in that way.  But I do get a huge paycheck next week and will buy a bed I'm proud of and I really just want to take steps in the right direction.  I wanna fight the good fight.  It's hard impressing a girl like you.
</p>
<p>
I don't wanna give up and be a loser the rest of my life.  I've tasted victory before.  I want to be a winner.  I don't want to have peaked in highschool.  I want my peak to be yet to come.  I'm not a huge fan of church and groupthink, but I would be honored to discuss God with you, and I know my bible pretty well.  
</p>
<p>
I'm sorry if I wasted your time.  Idk if it's "ew get away from me" or "he's hot but he's too much older".  I really don't know where I stand so I'm asking for help.  
</p>
<p>
You seem like a busy girl.  It probably wouldn't work between us.  Because I have a steady schedule with work and no school and a lot of time to date.  But it's just hard you know, after a rejection like this, and the likely end of all contact, it honestly makes me not want to try again for a while.  Maybe I wasted both our times.  I don't know what your alternative is to me.  But my alternative to you is extremely undesirable.  I wish I had more options, I just don't.  My best chance is with a girl I meet on the street.  And we live so close.  There's so much fun we could have together.  So much we could share.  I mean, I would love having you over for drinks or you doing the same for me, even if we weren't a couple.  It'd be nice to have a friend here.  I really do think I want a friend, but I only want that friend to be a pretty girl, so maybe I'm kidding myself.  
</p>
<p>
I don't expect you to read all this.  I shouldn't even bring it to your attention.  You may have already blocked my cell number cuz that's what girls do to me.  My plan was to call you on Thursday, I think you should be decent enough to discuss it a little bit on the phone at least.  
</p>
<p>
If I'm not fit enough for you, I accept that, because I can hit the gym.  But if being too old is the only thing preventing me from having you, well that is terrible because not only is it not true as we get older, but also there's nothing I can do about it.  I can't turn back the wheels of time.   I can't impress your friends or your family. 
</p>
<p>
But I know, if given the opportunity, I could be a good friend to you.  There's 63,000 ways you can benefit me in my current state.  And I wish I could have 1 way to benefit you.  If the only way I can benefit you is to leave you alone, I'd like you to be clear with me and say that.  Trust me, the last thing I want to do is scare you or creep you out.  I just want to get back to my old ways of being a normal guy.  I fell off the wagon for a minute and I could use some assistance on the way back.  I have a lot of potential and a lot of good qualities and writing super long messages to girls and not being obsessive isn't one of them.  But I'm not obsessed with you, I'm obsessed with the idea of you.  A desirable young woman. 
</p>
<p>
I'm done now.  As you know, I'm not that weird in person, and I know this message is strange.  But I believe in the truth and total communication.  Your tiny text is not very communicative.  On the one hand I hear you loud and clear, you're not interested in going to the movies with me on Thursday night or being my girlfriend.  On the other hand, I am deeply confused by your excuse or reason.  I mean, are you really letting a number of years someones been alive going to prevent you from having fun with someone you know you just had fun with?  Or did you not enjoy yourself with me?  If you tell me the truth I will leave you be, I swear.  But I think I deserve a little more clear of communicaiton from you.  It's my fault for getting my hopes up but it was you, not me, initiating the make out session.
</p>
<p>
God Bless,

Maxwell Lawrence Jann

                <h2>School of Rock</h2>
                <img class="picfloatsmall" src="static/img/schoolofrock.jpg" alt="schoolofrock">
                <p>
                    It's 1 o'clock in the morning and I have work tomorrow but I had to finish watching school of rock and now I have to blog about it while it's still fresh in my mind.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It reminded me of when I was a teacher and how awesome and full of potential kids are.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you've been living under a rock, I'll tell you real quick what it's about before I analyze it.  It's about a guy who can't pay his rent because he's trying to make it in a band.  Dewey (jack black) lives with his brother and his brother's girlfriend is pressuring him to tell Dewey to get a job or move out.  Meanwhile, Dewey also gets kicked out of his own band.
                </p>
                <p>
                    His phone rings and he decides to pretend to be his brother who is a substitute teacher.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    Then he goes to teach at a prep elementary school and collect the money letting the kids do whatever.  But then, it stops being about the paycheck.  He sees the kids during their music class and sees their potential.  Then he get's all engaged as a teacher and his passion takes over.  Nothing is better than teaching a kid something for the first time that you're passionate about.  Bringing what you love to their attention and seeing them experience it for the first time is epic. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Then he starts this whole class project called "Rock Band".  He plans on entering Battle of the Bands with the class. I forgot to mention he put out fliers and no one wanted to join his band.  
                </p>

                <p>
                    Anyway, the whole time I'm thinking about the ethical implications of what he's doing.  Are the kids missing out on a real education by studying rock and roll everyday?  No, they aren't.  Is math worth learning?  Yes, but you don't need to study it everyday.  That makes it boring.  Engaging the kids with passion is all that really matters.  If kids are engaged, you can teach a months worth of math in one day.  It's when it's monotonous and boring when it becomes difficult to teach.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Also, the idea of him not being qualified to be in front of children and teach, it's ridiculous.  He's the perfect teacher.  He's so honest, and genuine.  He wants the kids to unlock their potential.  He loves them.  It's beautiful to watch, seriously.  Kids are robbed of people like that and people like that have to basically lie to get in front of kids and teach what they're passionate about.  I remember teaching a lego robotics class but I was very into math at the time and I would teach the kids secret math lessons way above their grade level and it got them super-engaged.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Children will rise to whatever expectations are placed on them, without fail.  If you tell them they're all going to be treated like college kids, they'll start acting like it.  It's remarkable.  I had half the class teaching itself.  I'd teach one kid one thing and have him master it and then each kid was a master of one skill and they all taught themselves it.  Teaching is the best way to understand something.  So, that was my golden teaching method.  I think it could be widespread and incredibly impactful, so I'll have to revisit it.  But imagine if during middle school you got to read ahead about geology, or whatever your favorite subject is, and then teach the class that one subject, or lesson.  you would be pro at it.  And then all the "teacher" has to do is make sure each kid is master of one thing.  Then they will all naturally be dying to explain their expertise to one another.  It's impossible to have 7 expert kids in a room without them all sharing ideas.  It really does work.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I know it's just a fictional movie but it's such a great story and I love love loved watching it. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Rock on.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Also, all my rules had caveats.  Like No cell phones, unless you can solve this math problem.  Then, go on your phone the rest of class, I don't care. do you know how frantically the kids try to learn math when you attach a reward like that?  They leapfrog 50 IQ points and 5 grade levels I'm not kidding.  You can teach a kid algebra in 30 minutes with that trick.
                </p>
