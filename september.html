                <h2>The Assault on Masculinity</h2>
                <img class="picfloat" src="static/img/bond.jpg" alt="bond">
                <div class="vid">
                    <iframe width="100%" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uRsSmJ0iPXk" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
                </div>
                <p>
                    So I've been noticing this for a while.  This guy I often listen to does a really good job showing how masculine media is being overwritten by feminist garbage.  It's nothing against women, if a woman character exists, go for it.  But stop making masculin men get their asses kicked or replaced by strong females.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In Drake Uncharted 4 Drake can't take a girl in a fight basically ever.  He's been kicking everyones ass and then there's multiple sequences where he gets his ass beat by a girl and there's nothing the player can do to stop it. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now I'm hearing the new James Bond is infected with this bs and now even Thor is going to be a female.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now, I'm not here to state the obvious. Anyone can see this.  The question is why.  Why are they doing it?  Is it virtue signalling, or the changing of the times?  Are they giving the people what they want?
                </p>
                <p>
                    No, they aren't.  The quality of content sucks.  And they try to remove things like James Bond sleeping with a bunch of girls because it's awesome for men to see, and then they want to suck away all of the awesome and destroy all of masculinity so they have a bunch of pussies to easily rule over.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It is true that in the past, video game girls used to be just big tits and stuff like like, but we've swung so far in the other direction that now Abby in the Last of Us 2 has the biggest muscles in that game.  It's stupid and unrealistic.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    I think everyone is secretly starved for good old fashioned masculine and feminine roles.  I'm not even going to waste my time with disclaimers like some woman are strong and smart.  I want a story with a hot hopelessly weak princess getting rescued by a badass man who gets to bang her at the end. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    That's why I wrote Cloudland, and even part of the reason I had a mental breakdown.  I could see the attack on all masculinity, including my own.  I knew I had to shake things up with my behavior and rebel.  I ended up losing it but I still stand by the essential goal which is to be a real man. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    Andrew Kirby has a video where he explains how Alexander the Great was so obsessed with being the Alpha that he eventually had to call himself God because he didn't want God above him.  My mental breakdown was similar in that I renamed myself Elam Ahpla, the character in my story of a dragonslayer princess rescuing sword weilding hero.

                    The other video I want to share that I saw recently is from Quantum of Conscience.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I like Quantum of Conscience, 1st Man, and Andrew Kirby, in that order.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In this video he takes his famous half-page explanation of reality and extends it to 5 pages to truly explain it and I think he has a good grasp of how reality works.
                </p>
                <p>
                    He often says to examine what this reality wants you to do, or this society, and then just to do the opposite. So if they are trying to stamp out and ruin masculinity, I want to rebel in the opposite direction, I want to bring balance to the force.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Humans thrive when Men and Women embrace masculinity and feminitity respectively.  It's like a battery with opposite charges.  We cannot thrive without a strong charge in both directions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I just bought a Temper Pedic cloud mattress with my commission money and I will be building an excellent life for myself and have a beautiful girl on that bed and no one can stop me.  I just learned "Guarenteed" By Eddie Vedder on Guitar (Into the Wild) and I am forming a better life for myself.  I went swimming today and did pushups and I am excercising more frequently now.  If you want to look like a beast, you have to be a beast, and work like a beast.  I'm not working out like a beast, but I'm getting closer.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I want to be a James Bond type badass who sleeps with women and is ubermasculine and there's nothing wrong with that.  It's natural and it makes me happy.  Just like it's natural for a woman to want to do feminine things.  What's unnatrual is all this bullshit in the media confusing people and making them forget who they really are, which is what that QOC video is all about. It's about just moving past the conspiracies and focusing on who we really are and becoming the best versions of ourselves. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    God Bless Men and Women in their natural roles.  No disclaimers or virtue signalling here.

                <h2>Cinepolis Dream</h2>
                —


<p>
    Dream
</p>
<p>
My dad was throwing a lavish party with 100+ guests.
</p>
<p>
It was kind of like in CINEPOLIS
</p>
<p>
I was there hosting.
</p>
<p>
My dad arrived with important people and I briefly saw him.
</p>
<p>
Then Sven, Devin, and Andrew arrived
</p>
<p>
Sven and Andrew and Devin informed me that we were going out . ( you guys sometime don’t include me in plans but I’m still invited)
</p>
<p>
There was a line of people and I was searching the line for other “Giants” to take with us.  (Most my friends are tall). But you guys laughed and assured me we already had everyone.
</p>
<p>
I was laughing to myself that there was $1000’s of dollars worth of food in the party behind us but we were all going to pay to go out to dinner but it made sense because it was our last night together for a long time, and we were significantly younger than the crowd.  And we wanted some time with each other before returning to the party (maybe it was the premier of bug therapy).
Only catch, when we got outside, I was still in my socks.  Andrew was slightly annoyed, and said the taxi would be getting here any second, and I went to run back inside to find my shoes.
</p>
<p>
You guys all waited outside.
</p>
<p>
On my way deeper into cinepolis, I saw a wallet on the ground  by where Sven and Andrew were sitting, by the XBOX.  There was like a massive projector like near the bar in cinepolis where they put football on, and you guys had been playing halo.
</p>
<img class="picfloat" src="static/img/moneyclip.png" alt="moneyclip">
<p>
I noticed the wallet and picket it up, as well as several stray 100 dollar bills on the ground, at least a few.  I put them all in my hand and went deeper into the party.  Before I switched rooms, I turned to the old couple playing pool and said, “I’ll give these to my friends outside”… They nodded skeptically and said they would return it to lost and found if I hadn’t.  They knew you guys had been sitting over there.
</p>
<p>
Anyway now I’m inside the party again, my hands are full but I didn’t want to mix up your money with my money so I wasn’t putting it in my pockets.  I also didn’t check the wallet’s photo ID, I figured I’d just ask outside, and I thought about calling/texting but my hands were full and I had no idea where my shoes were.
</p>
<p>
Then I woke up!  LOL
</p>
<h4>Analysis</h4>
<p>
    I once had an experience working at cinepolis where I found a wallet with many hundreds in it.
</p>
<p>
    I only found it after everyone else on staff had given up looking but the man on the phone seemed desperate.
</p>
<p>
    I reached my arm deep down the seat he was at and found a wallet full of hundreds.
</p>
<p>
    I told the man and I gave it to him and he was worried sick but overjoyed when he knew he had enough to buy his kids christmas presents or something.  He gave me like $20 as a reward which I thought was small but looking back, his relief made it totally worthwhile and the reward was inconsequential compared to actually helping someone out.
</p>
<p>
    I also had another experience working at Brookestone at the mall where a shopped was dropping bills behind her accidentally as she walked and I grabbed them and chased her out the store to show her the money.
</p>
<p>
    Also sometimes my freinds have plans that involve me that I really have no say in the matter because of my financial struggles in years past.  That's no longer the case as much.  I just bought a temper pedic cloud bed!  I am going to turn my room into "Cloudland" the mythical place I invented in my <a href="story.html">story</a>
 </p>
 <p>
     Also my dad is starting to get famous for Bug Therapy and I didn't realize that until I woke up that it was probably a bug therapy premier.
 </p>
 <p>
     Back to sleep I think!

                    He talks about using leverage, like the ability to code or the internet or youtube reaching more people than you ever could in person, and making it profitable at scale.
                </p>

                    I've managed to turn part of this website into <a href="fantasy.html">content</a> for my fantasy league of 11 other guys, but imagine how profitable it could be if I had 1000 readers at $1 per month?

                        I really like this short video from this guy explaining that you should just start before you learn or you'll never get started.  Learn while you do.  Action is key.  I don't know how to manage my own chess business but I know at some point I want to have business cards.  So I'm just going to make business cards when I get my next paycheck.

                <h2>
                    Squirells getting their nuts
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm not going to delete my embarrassing rant about getting rejected because it's just something I'll learn from.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm actaully at peace with it now.  I texted her saying that I understand, and maybe I'll see her around.  Overall I sent 4 texts in the span of 2 days since her rejection test, and only one was a tad long.  Not the worst.  Probably an improvement.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm really proud of myself for getting as far as I did and putting myself out there.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There's an expression, "You only get the amount of love you think you deserve" and I think my opinion of myself is rising and I got what I thought I deserved, and no more.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Squirells gather nuts so that they never go hungry.  Squirrels must just know that it sucks to be hungry and have nothing to eat, so they think ahead.  Even when they're not hungry, they're always on the lookout for nuts.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I know I'll be horny at some point in the future.  It's completely inevitable.  The question is, will I be prepared and have a dime piece to lie down with?  When I first realized this terrible urge men face quite often alone, I hatched a long term plan to have a great sex life.  I've had a great sex life.  But it's gone out of wack and I'm out of shape with no girl.  And I gotta face facts if I'm ever going to get the nuts and prepare for winter like the squirrel.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So I just was at 7/11 cause I had an urge to get some drinks and snacks.  But I'm conscious of the ingredients because I've been running and swimming and lifting to improve my body.  But, every single thing I was craving had the main ingredient "corn syrup".  High fructose corn syrup.  In the powerade, life saver gummies, sour gummy worms.  Basically everything I like.  So I got sugar free powerade and chocolate covered pretzels.  I am going to try to swear off high fructose corn syrup and soda.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My new flip-flops and bathing suit make it much more inviting for me to go swimming.  I love my flip-flops!  I love life.  I know I can improve and get better.  Eventually I'll be ready to go on a date again, and if I work at it, one day I will get another girl I really actaully want and can be happy with.  See, someone told me recently it shouldn't be hard work, but I disagree.  The best girls are always hard work, because they're the most widely desirable and you have to blow them out of the water and blow the competition away.  You have to excel in every category.  Because a perfect 10 girl doesn't just select the hot guy.  There's many different guys she thinks are hot, and she selects the hot nice one.  Or, if she's selecting based on personality, there's plenty of guys with the personality she likes, so she'll go with the hottest one within that selected personality group.  So you have to work hard and dominate in all areas.  And the juice is worth the squeeze.
                </p>

                    I just got to speed up my excelling because these girls are saying I'm too old and I'm turning thirty.   Really I think some of the hottest girls on earth are probably from like 18-35.  The reason younger girls are appealing is that they're just less likely to be gross.  They are more likely to be clean and fit.  Idk.  As time goes on, maybe they start smoking cigarettes, or get tatoos you don't like, or drink too much, or something idk.  The perfect girl who stays looking young is probably like 24-25.  Because they do get hotter after 18,  but not all of them do.  It's only the ones who stay in shape and take care of themselves.

                    I've been looking to get a girl to do my first music video with me for "California" my song.  So I'll just ask her to do that and then give up on that one.

                <h2>The Imperfect Date</h2>
                <p>
                    Fitting to receive bad news on 9/11.  Although, I had kind of seen it coming
                </p>
                <p>
                    This week I worked up the courage to ask a pretty girl out on a date.
                </p>
                <p>
                    She said yes! and we went to dinner, and we kissed!
                </p>
                <p>
                    The next day, she sent me a text letting me know it's not going to work.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Here is my response.  For some reason  I can't write anything down without posting it.  And I want her to see it.  She's 22 and I'm 29.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Hi L******,
                </p>
                <p>
I want to tell you the truth about me before I let you go.  I'm a lonely guy.  I'm turning 30.  My good friends I have left live in Santa Monica.  I've been alone for a year or two since I broke up with my last girlfriend because I knew she wasn't who I really wanted and I was just using her for sex.  I've been trying to be at peace with being alone, but a man needs a woman.
</p>
<p>
I really do believe in God.  I don't like when I sin by watching porn but I don't have a healthy sexual outlet.  I started asking girls out in person that I thought were pretty, but I would get rejected.  When I tried dating apps, it was usually even worse.  I wouldn't match with the types of girls I think would satisfy me.
</p>
<p>
After getting rejected one day in person in a humiliating way, I decided to try harder.  I cut my hair differently, I shaved my beard more often, I started going to the gym a little bit and eating a little healthier, and I made sure I had nice clothes on for the next time I had the courage to approach a pretty girl.
</p>
<p>
Then I saw you walking towards me as I was walking the dog, and I thought I might as well give it another try.  You said yes, which was a surprise.  Then we texted and went out to dinner.  The whole time texting I was honestly just trying to not screw up the opportunity.  Then when we had our date, I really enjoyed it and I went for the kiss at the end so I could make my intentions clear.  I thought it would be a peck, or that you'd reject it, but instead you surprised me yet again by making out with me with lots of tongue.  
</p>
<p>
I figured I'd get to see you again so I quit while I was ahead.  I never expected to get this far with a girl like you.  I've had pretty girlfriends before but not since college.
</p>
<p>
Another truth is, I was in the mental hospital twice about a couple years ago, after I couldn't get the job at google, I kind of broke down with the pressure of having to pay for my life without a high-paying job I thought I was going to get.  
</p>
<p>
My delusions were related to my belief in Jesus and conspiracy theories.  At my worst, I toyed with the idea that I was the second coming.  It took me a while to come back from that.  I was on meds and in treatment and got out of both.  I used to smoke a lot of marijuana which contributed to my psychosis.
</p>
<p>
Anyway, I'm just a person trying to make it on this Earth, and I'm really sensitive with pretty girls' opinions of me because when they don't like me I tend not to feel good about myself.  I doubt myself and I lose self-respect and self-confidence from jerking off to porn alone.
</p>
<p>
But I know I'd rather be alone than settle with someone I know I'll never be in love with.  I know it'd be easy to fall in love with you.  You have the qualities I'm looking for.  And maybe you really are too young.  The truth is I wasted a lot of my 20's getting high and wallowing in sorrow over my highschool sweetheart leaving me in college.  I actaully flunked out of UCSC and had severe social anxiety.  Then I worked my way back into school to get my degree and I got a new girlfriend but I didn't want to do long-distance again once I graduated and she wasn't perfect for me. 
</p>
<p>
Anyway,  what I'm really trying to do here is give you some context for when I say I'm not expecting to go from 0-100 real quick.  I know there's a lot of miles I need to run on the treadmill before I can attract a girl of your quality, and I'm not there yet.  I wanted to make my intentions clear, just in case I got lucky and you gave me a chance as your boyfriend.
</p>
<p>
But, what I really want, is just to spend time with you or a girl like you, and gain self-respect and self-confidence in the presense of true beauty, which I think you are.  Now, maybe I am too old to be your boyfriend.  I wasn't even going to officially ask you to me my girlfriend because I know that can put way too much pressure on a relationship between people who just met.  But am I too old to be your friend?  I wouldn't mind being your friend.  I could learn so much from you.  And I wasn't pretending to be interested in you to get in your pants.  I actually am interested in you.  And, if we were just hanging out as friends, I can live with that, because I've taken my best shot at this time.  I want to try again later, but maybe not.  I mean, maybe there is a better match for both of us, and that's okay.  But what I don't want is to never see you again, or hear from you again, or to be on your "bad" list.
</p>
<p>
I'm just a man, who tried to get to know a woman.  Does it really have to be boyfriend or bust?  Can't we just be friends?
</p>
<p>
I don't know if age is the only thing.  Maybe you didn't feel a spark when we kissed.  But did you look me up?  Did you look me up online and see that I don't get 200 likes on instagram like you do?  I did excel at social media when I was your age too, I just don't anymore.  And also, did you read my blog, and judge me?  I mean I understand the impulse, but I'd love to know.  Am I just sabatoging myself for any future jobs or girlfriends with my blog?  
</p>
<p>
I wish you could help me, as a friend, and teach me how to find and keep a girl like you, starting from where I am.
</p>
<p>
I'm so curious what I did wrong, and why you kissed me the way you did.   Or, if you'll change your mind, or if you would have if I had just played it cool.  But it's not cool.  It's not cool to have me spend that much money and effort to date you and then you just throw me away with a little text.  I mean, I don't know what it's like to be a girl and have to put someone down easy, but I honestly expected a little bit more from you.   I knew something was wrong when you weren't texting me anything after our date, but I thought when a girl french kisses me it means she likes me.  I guess not.  And then I'm thinking to myself should I have asked to make out with you more in your car, and if we had established more of physical connection, maybe that'd be harder to leave.  But I wanted to respect the whole traditional dating thing we talking about.
</p>
<p>
I don't know how you feel about sex before marriage but that'd be a potential issue down the road anyway because I'm not keen on getting married soon.  I have a long way to go financially before I can think about a wife and kids.
</p>
<p>
I felt terrible most of the day at work after I got your text.  Then I felt a little better after I sent how I felt about it.
</p>
<p>
I know you don't owe me anything.  I just really want to avoid the worst case scenario which is no pretty girls in my life.  Like, I wish we could see where this goes.  I really tried.  I really would have tried every single date until I made you mine.  And it seems my best effort wasn't good enough and that's fine.  I wouldn't date me if I were you.  Maybe I wouldn't be my freind either.
</p>
<p>
But I thought you were different from other girls.  I saw real kindness in you, and intelligence.  When you say, "everyone is losing their minds" over Covid, I'm not.  We could be sane together.  I'm unvaccinated, and I don't appreciate mandates.  I gather you are vaccinated, which I understand given your profession and status as a student.  
</p>
<p>
That's all I really have to say.  As you can see, I'm a mess.  I'm not expecting to hit a home run with a cheerleader with the first girl I asked out since I started trying after abandoning a mentality of giving up.  I'm not asking you to be my girlfriend.  I just want to know if you really didn't have any fun, and if there's anything I could have done better.  Obviously I was smooth enough to get the number the date and the kiss, but I just really need to improve in the whole no girlfriend thing.  I don't even have a bed right now in my room.  I'm not ready for a girlfriend in that way.  But I do get a huge paycheck next week and will buy a bed I'm proud of and I really just want to take steps in the right direction.  I wanna fight the good fight.  It's hard impressing a girl like you.
</p>
<p>
I don't wanna give up and be a loser the rest of my life.  I've tasted victory before.  I want to be a winner.  I don't want to have peaked in highschool.  I want my peak to be yet to come.  I'm not a huge fan of church and groupthink, but I would be honored to discuss God with you, and I know my bible pretty well.  
</p>
<p>
I'm sorry if I wasted your time.  Idk if it's "ew get away from me" or "he's hot but he's too much older".  I really don't know where I stand so I'm asking for help.  
</p>
<p>
You seem like a busy girl.  It probably wouldn't work between us.  Because I have a steady schedule with work and no school and a lot of time to date.  But it's just hard you know, after a rejection like this, and the likely end of all contact, it honestly makes me not want to try again for a while.  Maybe I wasted both our times.  I don't know what your alternative is to me.  But my alternative to you is extremely undesirable.  I wish I had more options, I just don't.  My best chance is with a girl I meet on the street.  And we live so close.  There's so much fun we could have together.  So much we could share.  I mean, I would love having you over for drinks or you doing the same for me, even if we weren't a couple.  It'd be nice to have a friend here.  I really do think I want a friend, but I only want that friend to be a pretty girl, so maybe I'm kidding myself.  
</p>
<p>
I don't expect you to read all this.  I shouldn't even bring it to your attention.  You may have already blocked my cell number cuz that's what girls do to me.  My plan was to call you on Thursday, I think you should be decent enough to discuss it a little bit on the phone at least.  
</p>
<p>
If I'm not fit enough for you, I accept that, because I can hit the gym.  But if being too old is the only thing preventing me from having you, well that is terrible because not only is it not true as we get older, but also there's nothing I can do about it.  I can't turn back the wheels of time.   I can't impress your friends or your family. 
</p>
<p>
But I know, if given the opportunity, I could be a good friend to you.  There's 63,000 ways you can benefit me in my current state.  And I wish I could have 1 way to benefit you.  If the only way I can benefit you is to leave you alone, I'd like you to be clear with me and say that.  Trust me, the last thing I want to do is scare you or creep you out.  I just want to get back to my old ways of being a normal guy.  I fell off the wagon for a minute and I could use some assistance on the way back.  I have a lot of potential and a lot of good qualities and writing super long messages to girls and not being obsessive isn't one of them.  But I'm not obsessed with you, I'm obsessed with the idea of you.  A desirable young woman. 
</p>
<p>
I'm done now.  As you know, I'm not that weird in person, and I know this message is strange.  But I believe in the truth and total communication.  Your tiny text is not very communicative.  On the one hand I hear you loud and clear, you're not interested in going to the movies with me on Thursday night or being my girlfriend.  On the other hand, I am deeply confused by your excuse or reason.  I mean, are you really letting a number of years someones been alive going to prevent you from having fun with someone you know you just had fun with?  Or did you not enjoy yourself with me?  If you tell me the truth I will leave you be, I swear.  But I think I deserve a little more clear of communicaiton from you.  It's my fault for getting my hopes up but it was you, not me, initiating the make out session.
</p>
<p>
God Bless,

                <img class="picfloatsmall" src="static/img/schoolofrock.jpg" alt="schoolofrock">
                <p>
                    It's 1 o'clock in the morning and I have work tomorrow but I had to finish watching school of rock and now I have to blog about it while it's still fresh in my mind.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It reminded me of when I was a teacher and how awesome and full of potential kids are.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you've been living under a rock, I'll tell you real quick what it's about before I analyze it.  It's about a guy who can't pay his rent because he's trying to make it in a band.  Dewey (jack black) lives with his brother and his brother's girlfriend is pressuring him to tell Dewey to get a job or move out.  Meanwhile, Dewey also gets kicked out of his own band.
                </p>
                <p>
                    His phone rings and he decides to pretend to be his brother who is a substitute teacher.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    Then he goes to teach at a prep elementary school and collect the money letting the kids do whatever.  But then, it stops being about the paycheck.  He sees the kids during their music class and sees their potential.  Then he get's all engaged as a teacher and his passion takes over.  Nothing is better than teaching a kid something for the first time that you're passionate about.  Bringing what you love to their attention and seeing them experience it for the first time is epic. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Then he starts this whole class project called "Rock Band".  He plans on entering Battle of the Bands with the class. I forgot to mention he put out fliers and no one wanted to join his band.  
                </p>

                <p>
                    Anyway, the whole time I'm thinking about the ethical implications of what he's doing.  Are the kids missing out on a real education by studying rock and roll everyday?  No, they aren't.  Is math worth learning?  Yes, but you don't need to study it everyday.  That makes it boring.  Engaging the kids with passion is all that really matters.  If kids are engaged, you can teach a months worth of math in one day.  It's when it's monotonous and boring when it becomes difficult to teach.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Also, the idea of him not being qualified to be in front of children and teach, it's ridiculous.  He's the perfect teacher.  He's so honest, and genuine.  He wants the kids to unlock their potential.  He loves them.  It's beautiful to watch, seriously.  Kids are robbed of people like that and people like that have to basically lie to get in front of kids and teach what they're passionate about.  I remember teaching a lego robotics class but I was very into math at the time and I would teach the kids secret math lessons way above their grade level and it got them super-engaged.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Children will rise to whatever expectations are placed on them, without fail.  If you tell them they're all going to be treated like college kids, they'll start acting like it.  It's remarkable.  I had half the class teaching itself.  I'd teach one kid one thing and have him master it and then each kid was a master of one skill and they all taught themselves it.  Teaching is the best way to understand something.  So, that was my golden teaching method.  I think it could be widespread and incredibly impactful, so I'll have to revisit it.  But imagine if during middle school you got to read ahead about geology, or whatever your favorite subject is, and then teach the class that one subject, or lesson.  you would be pro at it.  And then all the "teacher" has to do is make sure each kid is master of one thing.  Then they will all naturally be dying to explain their expertise to one another.  It's impossible to have 7 expert kids in a room without them all sharing ideas.  It really does work.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I know it's just a fictional movie but it's such a great story and I love love loved watching it. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Rock on.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Also, all my rules had caveats.  Like No cell phones, unless you can solve this math problem.  Then, go on your phone the rest of class, I don't care. do you know how frantically the kids try to learn math when you attach a reward like that?  They leapfrog 50 IQ points and 5 grade levels I'm not kidding.  You can teach a kid algebra in 30 minutes with that trick.
                </p>
