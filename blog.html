                    I was listening to Christopher Hitchens today and he said religion is like a death cult, because in order to believe it you have to long for death, and subscribe to the idea of an apocalypse.  You have to consider all human progress as something to be discarded and started over.
                </p>
                <p>
                    He also pointed out that religions can satisfy the human need for obedience and slavery, essentially.  In light of a cosmic God one can only be a cosmic serf of sorts.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In my own personal experiennce I was at my most happiest when I wasn't particularly religious nor was I philosophical.  I was 20 and happy with the world and my place in it.  I didn't long for it to be over and to be placed in some sort of heaven.  And I didn't long to be told what to do by cosmic laws either.  I was content with making my own judgements and decisions.  And of course, church was always seen as a drag.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Neil Degrasse Tyson also said today to me in that same video, "The Universe is knowable".  Do not try to ascribe what you don't understand to the mystical or magical.
                </p>

                    Recently I was watching a QOC video where he points out how impossibly fast Google's search results are, and he did have some excellent points, however, he had a basic misunderstanding of how search engines work.  He thought it was searching the whole web in less than a second and returning results.  In reality, I think it works more like a search engine working around the clock and organizing everything so that when you type in a search it just filters the list it already possesses.  It doesn't start from scratch.  It just goes to the section of it's library that you need.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I don't want to point at things I don't understand and make foolish claims about it.  I'm not taking magic off of the table either.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Matt from Quantum of Conscience has stopped researching thoroughly.  As he points out, you never get anywhere or convince anyone, so it must be pointless.  He says it (reality itself) will give you what it wants you to chase.  You certainly end up in a pointless loop.  So it's not worth investigating what kind of poop it is if you know it's poop.  Just stay away.  You don't have to do a chemical analysis. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    But it's got me thinking.  I'm disappointed in believing in God.  I'm disappointed in myself.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    I went to West Hollywood and had a birthday dinner with some friends and we went out to the bar and there were a lot of pretty girls and I talked to a lot of them.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I came home empty handed.  The best interaction I had was with the prettiest girl there.  She had a boyfriend who came in with her but I told her when she was alone that she was the prettiest girl there.  She really was a stunner.  She believed me and was nice to me.  Later I went back to talk to her again and officially ask her on a date but she said she couldn't because of the bf.  I then asked for her advice on what I can improve on so I can get a girl like her.  She asked me to hold her drink and then unbuttoned my shirt.  I had it buttoned up because I had no undershirt because I had gotten it wet earlier when I got out of the jacuzzi.  She said to stay authentic and try again.  There was nothing she could really tell me.  I already know the answer.  It's just hard work I am having trouble getting myself to do.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Another girl told me to be persistent, which I thought was interesting.
                </p>

                    The trouble with cocaine is you think you're a success when you're on it, and you feel like a failure coming down.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The trouble with porn is you are experiencing what it's like to be with a woman, while at the same time distancing yourself from getting a real woman.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Drugs and shortcuts don't work.  There's no easy way to get anything worthwhile.  Is that God?  Is that Evolution?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Should I curse existence for dangling things in front of me that I cannot currently have, or may never have?  Or should I thank God for giving me something I desire and can work toward achieving.  Would it be easier if all girls were hot and horny and thought I was dead sexy?  Or is it the perfect balance?                
                </p>
                <p>
                    It's such a fundamental desire, that it's very hard to not consider myself a failure, turning 30, single and alone.  On the other hand, I'm glad I'm single, and only want to spend my time on high-quality women.  Extremely high-quality woman.  I really only had eyes on that one girl, and I'm not really capable of giving it my all with a consolation girl.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    On the bright side, at least I'm still young enough to turn things around.  I also do not lack the confidence to approach and try to get a girl like that.  I am unsuccessful, but at least I have the ability to succeed.

                    When I see an internship for Insomniac Games which made Spiderman and Ratchet and Clank, I read the job requirements and realize I'm not qualified.  It really stinks.  It requires C++ or a math or physics major or computer science major.  I know C# and have a coding bootcamp certificate.  Not quite there, but I'm also not completely far off.  My life has probably never been more in the balance.  I could resign to failure and long for an afterlife, another life, the end of the world.  Or, I could strive to be better, learn more and understand more about the world, and to participate in actively helping that world grow.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In that vein, religious beliefs seem like death, and realistic beliefs seem like life.  But of course it's more complicated than that, and Jesus said quite the opposite.  But even Jesus I have a problem with right now.  Suppose I get with a girl and she's Christian and she likes me back.  What if she doesn't have sex with me because we're not married or something?  Isn't that just basing a serious decision on fable?  There is no hard evidence that God exists and doesn't want you to fuck.  And if he did, why did he make it so damn alluring?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Tonight, Thunder roared and the sky cried, and it felt like God weeping for losing one of his Christian believers, and I thought about why people thought Thor would be angry at me for discounting him and his hammer.

                    I look at the way Ozark portrayed the Pastor, and I think it was purposefully to make Christians seem insane, which actually lends credibility to religion in my eyes.  However, Game of Thrones does an excellent job of showing how realistic these fake religions can get.  Everyone just goes along with the Lord of Light or the Seven, and it all seems perfectly normal.  It fits right in with our religions of the past and present, and yet it's being make-believe forms no noticable seperation from our own.

                    I'm not ready to throw Jesus out completely, and I'm even less ready to throw out conspiracies or the Mandela Effect.   But,  I will not fall into lazy thinking of calling things I can't explain magic.  And I will not curse this world and long for the next.  I will also not take my values from some outside source.  I will do what I think is right.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My experiences recently have given me a lot to think about and there's multiple ways to interpret it in both positive and negative ways.  I'm not trying to teach you anymore, I'm more interested in just getting what I want and learning how to get it.

                    I need a better desk and that's what I'm going to get.

                <img class="picfloatverysmall" src="static/img/tim-ferriss.jpg" alt="tim">
                <p>
                    I was just listening to Tim Ferris of the 4 hour workweek interviewing Ryan Holiday, the bestselling author of "The Obstacle is the way", a book about Stoicism.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Why?  1) Someone I admire who has a beach view from their bedroom reads his books and 2) I am a philosophy major and I'm a fan of philosophy the way someone is a fan of sports.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Tim asked Ryan, "What are some mistakes writer's make?"  My ears perked up, because I write this blog and want it to be better.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "People often write without having anything interesting to say".  "Or they just start writing and try to find the point as they go along".
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm guilty of this, but not every time, not this time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Discovery writing is when you write without an end in mind and get your thoughts flowing.  This technique is useful for writing novels, so I've heard from Brandon Sanderson in his creative writing course on youtube.  But that's not what I've been doing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I've been writing, blogging, and making a habit of creating content because I want to improve at it and I'm not going to let fear of failure get in my way.  I started this website in January and I now have 9 months of experience of writing and maintaining a blog and coding this website.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    So for my own personal development each post has been worthwhile, something to learn from.  But in the interest of improving the quality of this blog for my readers, I am going to start taking steps toward using what I've learned to write a better blog, instead of just doing it for experimental purposes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Blogging, like journaling, is therapeudic.  It's almost addictive.  Sometimes I just like to create instead of consume.  But, as a songwriter, I know, you can't force the writing of a good song.  It just happens.  Some days, there's nothing there.  A few days or weeks go by, you pick up the guitar and then BAM! the song writes itself.  Everything you've been processing or daydreaming about just comes out all at once.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Blogging is the same.  Sometimes I'm forcing it but I really just have nothing interesting to say which is the main ingredient you need.  However, there are days where some insight occurs to me and I just have to turn it into a well thought out blog post.  Sometimes, like the song, the blog writes itself.
                </p>

                <p>
                    That said, I'm going to promote myself to Editor and go back and comb over the past posts I think.  As much as I like authenticity I also think it'd be nice to delete my bad posts and just leave the good ones for any future readers who want to start from the beginning.
                </p>
                    <h2>The thing I have to say</h2>
                <p>
                    The interesting thing I have to say is about finally setting a schedule.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After having the recent experience with going on a date with a desirable girl, I have realized what I want to achieve.
                </p>
                <img class="picfloat" src="static/img/xx.jpg" alt="xx">
                <audio src="static/audio/crystal.mp3" controls></audio>
                <p>
                    Once I really crystallized my goal of being a desirable partner for a desirable woman, (because, let's be honest, guy's, I think girls are God's best offer to us for satisfaction in this world)... Once I crystallized my goal I was able to set a schedule of what my ideal day would be, that would also be conducive to achieving my ideal self.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I work from 9:20-6:00 in insurance.  I decided my ideal workday, if I'm to be the man I want to be and get the girl I want to get, etc... I have to wake up before 7AM, eat breakfast, go to the gym and break a sweat, then come back and shower, and then spend a half hour to an hour on my personal business plans, and then I can go work for someone else to pay the bills, and then when I get off of work, I'm making a new schedule.  To be honest I haven't figured out how I want the nights to go, but my morning was near perfect.  I just need to go to bed early enough to do it again tomorrow.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm turning 30 in a week.  I made a video called turning30 a while back and shared my thoughts on turning 30.  I have been thinking about it for a while and I'm faily comfortable with where I'm at moving into my 30's.  I have clear goals, priorities, skills, a job with room for extra income, and a website people use for my fantasy football articles.  I'm pretty happy with my progress.

                    So I've been noticing this for a while.  This guy I often listen to does a really good job showing how masculine media is being overwritten by feminist garbage.  It's nothing against women, if a woman character exists, go for it.  But stop making masculin men get their asses kicked or replaced by strong females.

                <p>
                    In Drake Uncharted 4 Drake can't take a girl in a fight basically ever.  He's been kicking everyones ass and then there's multiple sequences where he gets his ass beat by a girl and there's nothing the player can do to stop it. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now I'm hearing the new James Bond is infected with this bs and now even Thor is going to be a female.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now, I'm not here to state the obvious. Anyone can see this.  The question is why.  Why are they doing it?  Is it virtue signalling, or the changing of the times?  Are they giving the people what they want?
                </p>
                <p>
                    No, they aren't.  The quality of content sucks.  And they try to remove things like James Bond sleeping with a bunch of girls because it's awesome for men to see, and then they want to suck away all of the awesome and destroy all of masculinity so they have a bunch of pussies to easily rule over.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It is true that in the past, video game girls used to be just big tits and stuff like like, but we've swung so far in the other direction that now Abby in the Last of Us 2 has the biggest muscles in that game.  It's stupid and unrealistic.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    I think everyone is secretly starved for good old fashioned masculine and feminine roles.  I'm not even going to waste my time with disclaimers like some woman are strong and smart.  I want a story with a hot hopelessly weak princess getting rescued by a badass man who gets to bang her at the end. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    That's why I wrote Cloudland, and even part of the reason I had a mental breakdown.  I could see the attack on all masculinity, including my own.  I knew I had to shake things up with my behavior and rebel.  I ended up losing it but I still stand by the essential goal which is to be a real man.

                    Andrew Kirby has a video where he explains how Alexander the Great was so obsessed with being the Alpha that he eventually had to call himself God because he didn't want God above him.  My mental breakdown was similar in that I renamed myself Elam Ahpla, the character in my story of a dragonslayer princess rescuing sword weilding hero.

                    In this video he takes his famous half-page explanation of reality and extends it to 5 pages to truly explain it and I think he has a good grasp of how reality works.
                </p>
                <p>
                    He often says to examine what this reality wants you to do, or this society, and then just to do the opposite. So if they are trying to stamp out and ruin masculinity, I want to rebel in the opposite direction, I want to bring balance to the force.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Humans thrive when Men and Women embrace masculinity and feminitity respectively.  It's like a battery with opposite charges.  We cannot thrive without a strong charge in both directions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I just bought a Temper Pedic cloud mattress with my commission money and I will be building an excellent life for myself and have a beautiful girl on that bed and no one can stop me.  I just learned "Guarenteed" By Eddie Vedder on Guitar (Into the Wild) and I am forming a better life for myself.  I went swimming today and did pushups and I am excercising more frequently now.  If you want to look like a beast, you have to be a beast, and work like a beast.  I'm not working out like a beast, but I'm getting closer.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I want to be a James Bond type badass who sleeps with women and is ubermasculine and there's nothing wrong with that.  It's natural and it makes me happy.  Just like it's natural for a woman to want to do feminine things.  What's unnatrual is all this bullshit in the media confusing people and making them forget who they really are, which is what that QOC video is all about. It's about just moving past the conspiracies and focusing on who we really are and becoming the best versions of ourselves.

                    God Bless Men and Women in their natural roles.  No disclaimers or virtue signalling here.

                <h2>Cinepolis Dream</h2>
                —


<p>
    Dream
</p>
<p>
My dad was throwing a lavish party with 100+ guests.
</p>
<p>
It was kind of like in CINEPOLIS
</p>
<p>
I was there hosting.
</p>
<p>
My dad arrived with important people and I briefly saw him.
</p>
<p>
Then Sven, Devin, and Andrew arrived
</p>
<p>
Sven and Andrew and Devin informed me that we were going out . ( you guys sometime don’t include me in plans but I’m still invited)
</p>
<p>
There was a line of people and I was searching the line for other “Giants” to take with us.  (Most my friends are tall). But you guys laughed and assured me we already had everyone.
</p>
<p>
I was laughing to myself that there was $1000’s of dollars worth of food in the party behind us but we were all going to pay to go out to dinner but it made sense because it was our last night together for a long time, and we were significantly younger than the crowd.  And we wanted some time with each other before returning to the party (maybe it was the premier of bug therapy).
Only catch, when we got outside, I was still in my socks.  Andrew was slightly annoyed, and said the taxi would be getting here any second, and I went to run back inside to find my shoes.
</p>
<p>
You guys all waited outside.
</p>
<p>
On my way deeper into cinepolis, I saw a wallet on the ground  by where Sven and Andrew were sitting, by the XBOX.  There was like a massive projector like near the bar in cinepolis where they put football on, and you guys had been playing halo.
</p>
<img class="picfloat" src="static/img/moneyclip.png" alt="moneyclip">

<p>
I noticed the wallet and picket it up, as well as several stray 100 dollar bills on the ground, at least a few.  I put them all in my hand and went deeper into the party.  Before I switched rooms, I turned to the old couple playing pool and said, “I’ll give these to my friends outside”… They nodded skeptically and said they would return it to lost and found if I hadn’t.  They knew you guys had been sitting over there.
</p>
<p>
Anyway now I’m inside the party again, my hands are full but I didn’t want to mix up your money with my money so I wasn’t putting it in my pockets.  I also didn’t check the wallet’s photo ID, I figured I’d just ask outside, and I thought about calling/texting but my hands were full and I had no idea where my shoes were.
</p>
<p>
Then I woke up!  LOL
</p>
<h4>Analysis</h4>
<p>
    I once had an experience working at cinepolis where I found a wallet with many hundreds in it.
</p>
<p>
    I only found it after everyone else on staff had given up looking but the man on the phone seemed desperate.
</p>
<p>
    I reached my arm deep down the seat he was at and found a wallet full of hundreds.
</p>
<p>
    I told the man and I gave it to him and he was worried sick but overjoyed when he knew he had enough to buy his kids christmas presents or something.  He gave me like $20 as a reward which I thought was small but looking back, his relief made it totally worthwhile and the reward was inconsequential compared to actually helping someone out.
</p>
<p>
    I also had another experience working at Brookestone at the mall where a shopped was dropping bills behind her accidentally as she walked and I grabbed them and chased her out the store to show her the money.
</p>
<p>
    Also sometimes my freinds have plans that involve me that I really have no say in the matter because of my financial struggles in years past.  That's no longer the case as much.  I just bought a temper pedic cloud bed!  I am going to turn my room into "Cloudland" the mythical place I invented in my <a href="story.html">story</a>
 </p>
 <p>
     Also my dad is starting to get famous for Bug Therapy and I didn't realize that until I woke up that it was probably a bug therapy premier.
 </p>
 <p>
     Back to sleep I think!

                <p>
                    He talks about using leverage, like the ability to code or the internet or youtube reaching more people than you ever could in person, and making it profitable at scale.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I've managed to turn part of this website into <a href="fantasy.html">content</a> for my fantasy league of 11 other guys, but imagine how profitable it could be if I had 1000 readers at $1 per month?

                        I really like this short video from this guy explaining that you should just start before you learn or you'll never get started.  Learn while you do.  Action is key.  I don't know how to manage my own chess business but I know at some point I want to have business cards.  So I'm just going to make business cards when I get my next paycheck.

                    Squirells getting their nuts
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm not going to delete my embarrassing rant about getting rejected because it's just something I'll learn from.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm actaully at peace with it now.  I texted her saying that I understand, and maybe I'll see her around.  Overall I sent 4 texts in the span of 2 days since her rejection test, and only one was a tad long.  Not the worst.  Probably an improvement.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm really proud of myself for getting as far as I did and putting myself out there.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There's an expression, "You only get the amount of love you think you deserve" and I think my opinion of myself is rising and I got what I thought I deserved, and no more.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Squirells gather nuts so that they never go hungry.  Squirrels must just know that it sucks to be hungry and have nothing to eat, so they think ahead.  Even when they're not hungry, they're always on the lookout for nuts.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I know I'll be horny at some point in the future.  It's completely inevitable.  The question is, will I be prepared and have a dime piece to lie down with?  When I first realized this terrible urge men face quite often alone, I hatched a long term plan to have a great sex life.  I've had a great sex life.  But it's gone out of wack and I'm out of shape with no girl.  And I gotta face facts if I'm ever going to get the nuts and prepare for winter like the squirrel.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So I just was at 7/11 cause I had an urge to get some drinks and snacks.  But I'm conscious of the ingredients because I've been running and swimming and lifting to improve my body.  But, every single thing I was craving had the main ingredient "corn syrup".  High fructose corn syrup.  In the powerade, life saver gummies, sour gummy worms.  Basically everything I like.  So I got sugar free powerade and chocolate covered pretzels.  I am going to try to swear off high fructose corn syrup and soda.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My new flip-flops and bathing suit make it much more inviting for me to go swimming.  I love my flip-flops!  I love life.  I know I can improve and get better.  Eventually I'll be ready to go on a date again, and if I work at it, one day I will get another girl I really actaully want and can be happy with.  See, someone told me recently it shouldn't be hard work, but I disagree.  The best girls are always hard work, because they're the most widely desirable and you have to blow them out of the water and blow the competition away.  You have to excel in every category.  Because a perfect 10 girl doesn't just select the hot guy.  There's many different guys she thinks are hot, and she selects the hot nice one.  Or, if she's selecting based on personality, there's plenty of guys with the personality she likes, so she'll go with the hottest one within that selected personality group.  So you have to work hard and dominate in all areas.  And the juice is worth the squeeze.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I just got to speed up my excelling because these girls are saying I'm too old and I'm turning thirty.   Really I think some of the hottest girls on earth are probably from like 18-35.  The reason younger girls are appealing is that they're just less likely to be gross.  They are more likely to be clean and fit.  Idk.  As time goes on, maybe they start smoking cigarettes, or get tatoos you don't like, or drink too much, or something idk.  The perfect girl who stays looking young is probably like 24-25.  Because they do get hotter after 18,  but not all of them do.  It's only the ones who stay in shape and take care of themselves.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Anyway, gotta update the <a href="fantasy.html">fantasy ranks</a>
                </p>
                <p>Peace!</p>

                <p>
                    This week I worked up the courage to ask a pretty girl out on a date.
                </p>
                <p>
                    She said yes! and we went to dinner, and we kissed!

                    Here is my response.  For some reason  I can't write anything down without posting it.  And I want her to see it. She's 22 and I'm 29.

                <p>
I want to tell you the truth about me before I let you go.  I'm a lonely guy.  I'm turning 30.  My good friends I have left live in Santa Monica.  I've been alone for a year or two since I broke up with my last girlfriend because I knew she wasn't who I really wanted and I was just using her for sex.  I've been trying to be at peace with being alone, but a man needs a woman.
</p>
<p>
I really do believe in God.  I don't like when I sin by watching porn but I don't have a healthy sexual outlet.  I started asking girls out in person that I thought were pretty, but I would get rejected.  When I tried dating apps, it was usually even worse.  I wouldn't match with the types of girls I think would satisfy me.
</p>
<p>
After getting rejected one day in person in a humiliating way, I decided to try harder.  I cut my hair differently, I shaved my beard more often, I started going to the gym a little bit and eating a little healthier, and I made sure I had nice clothes on for the next time I had the courage to approach a pretty girl.
</p>
<p>
Then I saw you walking towards me as I was walking the dog, and I thought I might as well give it another try.  You said yes, which was a surprise.  Then we texted and went out to dinner.  The whole time texting I was honestly just trying to not screw up the opportunity.  Then when we had our date, I really enjoyed it and I went for the kiss at the end so I could make my intentions clear.  I thought it would be a peck, or that you'd reject it, but instead you surprised me yet again by making out with me with lots of tongue.  
</p>
<p>
I figured I'd get to see you again so I quit while I was ahead.  I never expected to get this far with a girl like you.  I've had pretty girlfriends before but not since college.
</p>
<p>
Another truth is, I was in the mental hospital twice about a couple years ago, after I couldn't get the job at google, I kind of broke down with the pressure of having to pay for my life without a high-paying job I thought I was going to get.  
</p>
<p>
My delusions were related to my belief in Jesus and conspiracy theories.  At my worst, I toyed with the idea that I was the second coming.  It took me a while to come back from that.  I was on meds and in treatment and got out of both.  I used to smoke a lot of marijuana which contributed to my psychosis.
</p>
<p>
Anyway, I'm just a person trying to make it on this Earth, and I'm really sensitive with pretty girls' opinions of me because when they don't like me I tend not to feel good about myself.  I doubt myself and I lose self-respect and self-confidence from jerking off to porn alone.
</p>
<p>
But I know I'd rather be alone than settle with someone I know I'll never be in love with.  I know it'd be easy to fall in love with you.  You have the qualities I'm looking for.  And maybe you really are too young.  The truth is I wasted a lot of my 20's getting high and wallowing in sorrow over my highschool sweetheart leaving me in college.  I actaully flunked out of UCSC and had severe social anxiety.  Then I worked my way back into school to get my degree and I got a new girlfriend but I didn't want to do long-distance again once I graduated and she wasn't perfect for me. 
</p>
<p>
Anyway,  what I'm really trying to do here is give you some context for when I say I'm not expecting to go from 0-100 real quick.  I know there's a lot of miles I need to run on the treadmill before I can attract a girl of your quality, and I'm not there yet.  I wanted to make my intentions clear, just in case I got lucky and you gave me a chance as your boyfriend.
</p>
<p>
But, what I really want, is just to spend time with you or a girl like you, and gain self-respect and self-confidence in the presense of true beauty, which I think you are.  Now, maybe I am too old to be your boyfriend.  I wasn't even going to officially ask you to me my girlfriend because I know that can put way too much pressure on a relationship between people who just met.  But am I too old to be your friend?  I wouldn't mind being your friend.  I could learn so much from you.  And I wasn't pretending to be interested in you to get in your pants.  I actually am interested in you.  And, if we were just hanging out as friends, I can live with that, because I've taken my best shot at this time.  I want to try again later, but maybe not.  I mean, maybe there is a better match for both of us, and that's okay.  But what I don't want is to never see you again, or hear from you again, or to be on your "bad" list.
</p>
<p>
I'm just a man, who tried to get to know a woman.  Does it really have to be boyfriend or bust?  Can't we just be friends?
</p>
<p>
I don't know if age is the only thing.  Maybe you didn't feel a spark when we kissed.  But did you look me up?  Did you look me up online and see that I don't get 200 likes on instagram like you do?  I did excel at social media when I was your age too, I just don't anymore.  And also, did you read my blog, and judge me?  I mean I understand the impulse, but I'd love to know.  Am I just sabatoging myself for any future jobs or girlfriends with my blog?  
</p>
<p>
I wish you could help me, as a friend, and teach me how to find and keep a girl like you, starting from where I am.
</p>
<p>
I'm so curious what I did wrong, and why you kissed me the way you did.   Or, if you'll change your mind, or if you would have if I had just played it cool.  But it's not cool.  It's not cool to have me spend that much money and effort to date you and then you just throw me away with a little text.  I mean, I don't know what it's like to be a girl and have to put someone down easy, but I honestly expected a little bit more from you.   I knew something was wrong when you weren't texting me anything after our date, but I thought when a girl french kisses me it means she likes me.  I guess not.  And then I'm thinking to myself should I have asked to make out with you more in your car, and if we had established more of physical connection, maybe that'd be harder to leave.  But I wanted to respect the whole traditional dating thing we talking about.
</p>
<p>
I don't know how you feel about sex before marriage but that'd be a potential issue down the road anyway because I'm not keen on getting married soon.  I have a long way to go financially before I can think about a wife and kids.
</p>
<p>
I felt terrible most of the day at work after I got your text.  Then I felt a little better after I sent how I felt about it.
</p>
<p>
I know you don't owe me anything.  I just really want to avoid the worst case scenario which is no pretty girls in my life.  Like, I wish we could see where this goes.  I really tried.  I really would have tried every single date until I made you mine.  And it seems my best effort wasn't good enough and that's fine.  I wouldn't date me if I were you.  Maybe I wouldn't be my freind either.
</p>
<p>
But I thought you were different from other girls.  I saw real kindness in you, and intelligence.  When you say, "everyone is losing their minds" over Covid, I'm not.  We could be sane together.  I'm unvaccinated, and I don't appreciate mandates.  I gather you are vaccinated, which I understand given your profession and status as a student.  
</p>
<p>
That's all I really have to say.  As you can see, I'm a mess.  I'm not expecting to hit a home run with a cheerleader with the first girl I asked out since I started trying after abandoning a mentality of giving up.  I'm not asking you to be my girlfriend.  I just want to know if you really didn't have any fun, and if there's anything I could have done better.  Obviously I was smooth enough to get the number the date and the kiss, but I just really need to improve in the whole no girlfriend thing.  I don't even have a bed right now in my room.  I'm not ready for a girlfriend in that way.  But I do get a huge paycheck next week and will buy a bed I'm proud of and I really just want to take steps in the right direction.  I wanna fight the good fight.  It's hard impressing a girl like you.
</p>
<p>
I don't wanna give up and be a loser the rest of my life.  I've tasted victory before.  I want to be a winner.  I don't want to have peaked in highschool.  I want my peak to be yet to come.  I'm not a huge fan of church and groupthink, but I would be honored to discuss God with you, and I know my bible pretty well.  
</p>
<p>
I'm sorry if I wasted your time.  Idk if it's "ew get away from me" or "he's hot but he's too much older".  I really don't know where I stand so I'm asking for help.  
</p>
<p>
You seem like a busy girl.  It probably wouldn't work between us.  Because I have a steady schedule with work and no school and a lot of time to date.  But it's just hard you know, after a rejection like this, and the likely end of all contact, it honestly makes me not want to try again for a while.  Maybe I wasted both our times.  I don't know what your alternative is to me.  But my alternative to you is extremely undesirable.  I wish I had more options, I just don't.  My best chance is with a girl I meet on the street.  And we live so close.  There's so much fun we could have together.  So much we could share.  I mean, I would love having you over for drinks or you doing the same for me, even if we weren't a couple.  It'd be nice to have a friend here.  I really do think I want a friend, but I only want that friend to be a pretty girl, so maybe I'm kidding myself.  
</p>
<p>
I don't expect you to read all this.  I shouldn't even bring it to your attention.  You may have already blocked my cell number cuz that's what girls do to me.  My plan was to call you on Thursday, I think you should be decent enough to discuss it a little bit on the phone at least.  
</p>
<p>
If I'm not fit enough for you, I accept that, because I can hit the gym.  But if being too old is the only thing preventing me from having you, well that is terrible because not only is it not true as we get older, but also there's nothing I can do about it.  I can't turn back the wheels of time.   I can't impress your friends or your family. 
</p>
<p>
But I know, if given the opportunity, I could be a good friend to you.  There's 63,000 ways you can benefit me in my current state.  And I wish I could have 1 way to benefit you.  If the only way I can benefit you is to leave you alone, I'd like you to be clear with me and say that.  Trust me, the last thing I want to do is scare you or creep you out.  I just want to get back to my old ways of being a normal guy.  I fell off the wagon for a minute and I could use some assistance on the way back.  I have a lot of potential and a lot of good qualities and writing super long messages to girls and not being obsessive isn't one of them.  But I'm not obsessed with you, I'm obsessed with the idea of you.  A desirable young woman. 
</p>
<p>
I'm done now.  As you know, I'm not that weird in person, and I know this message is strange.  But I believe in the truth and total communication.  Your tiny text is not very communicative.  On the one hand I hear you loud and clear, you're not interested in going to the movies with me on Thursday night or being my girlfriend.  On the other hand, I am deeply confused by your excuse or reason.  I mean, are you really letting a number of years someones been alive going to prevent you from having fun with someone you know you just had fun with?  Or did you not enjoy yourself with me?  If you tell me the truth I will leave you be, I swear.  But I think I deserve a little more clear of communicaiton from you.  It's my fault for getting my hopes up but it was you, not me, initiating the make out session.
</p>
<p>
God Bless,

Maxwell Lawrence Jann

                <img class="picfloatsmall" src="static/img/schoolofrock.jpg" alt="schoolofrock">
                <p>
                    It's 1 o'clock in the morning and I have work tomorrow but I had to finish watching school of rock and now I have to blog about it while it's still fresh in my mind.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It reminded me of when I was a teacher and how awesome and full of potential kids are.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you've been living under a rock, I'll tell you real quick what it's about before I analyze it.  It's about a guy who can't pay his rent because he's trying to make it in a band.  Dewey (jack black) lives with his brother and his brother's girlfriend is pressuring him to tell Dewey to get a job or move out.  Meanwhile, Dewey also gets kicked out of his own band.
                </p>
                <p>
                    His phone rings and he decides to pretend to be his brother who is a substitute teacher.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    Then he goes to teach at a prep elementary school and collect the money letting the kids do whatever.  But then, it stops being about the paycheck.  He sees the kids during their music class and sees their potential.  Then he get's all engaged as a teacher and his passion takes over.  Nothing is better than teaching a kid something for the first time that you're passionate about.  Bringing what you love to their attention and seeing them experience it for the first time is epic. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Then he starts this whole class project called "Rock Band".  He plans on entering Battle of the Bands with the class. I forgot to mention he put out fliers and no one wanted to join his band.  
                </p>

                <p>
                    Anyway, the whole time I'm thinking about the ethical implications of what he's doing.  Are the kids missing out on a real education by studying rock and roll everyday?  No, they aren't.  Is math worth learning?  Yes, but you don't need to study it everyday.  That makes it boring.  Engaging the kids with passion is all that really matters.  If kids are engaged, you can teach a months worth of math in one day.  It's when it's monotonous and boring when it becomes difficult to teach.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Also, the idea of him not being qualified to be in front of children and teach, it's ridiculous.  He's the perfect teacher.  He's so honest, and genuine.  He wants the kids to unlock their potential.  He loves them.  It's beautiful to watch, seriously.  Kids are robbed of people like that and people like that have to basically lie to get in front of kids and teach what they're passionate about.  I remember teaching a lego robotics class but I was very into math at the time and I would teach the kids secret math lessons way above their grade level and it got them super-engaged.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Children will rise to whatever expectations are placed on them, without fail.  If you tell them they're all going to be treated like college kids, they'll start acting like it.  It's remarkable.  I had half the class teaching itself.  I'd teach one kid one thing and have him master it and then each kid was a master of one skill and they all taught themselves it.  Teaching is the best way to understand something.  So, that was my golden teaching method.  I think it could be widespread and incredibly impactful, so I'll have to revisit it.  But imagine if during middle school you got to read ahead about geology, or whatever your favorite subject is, and then teach the class that one subject, or lesson.  you would be pro at it.  And then all the "teacher" has to do is make sure each kid is master of one thing.  Then they will all naturally be dying to explain their expertise to one another.  It's impossible to have 7 expert kids in a room without them all sharing ideas.  It really does work.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I know it's just a fictional movie but it's such a great story and I love love loved watching it. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Rock on.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Also, all my rules had caveats.  Like No cell phones, unless you can solve this math problem.  Then, go on your phone the rest of class, I don't care. do you know how frantically the kids try to learn math when you attach a reward like that?  They leapfrog 50 IQ points and 5 grade levels I'm not kidding.  You can teach a kid algebra in 30 minutes with that trick.
                </p>

                    <p>
                        "The secret to greatness is progress." - Ryan Holliday.  I love this little video by Ryan, a philosophy author, because one cannot be great without first making progress.  Therefore if I focus on progress, I don't have to worry about greatness.  It will just come.  Tom Brady is the epitome of progress.  He is great because he works hard and tries to get better every day.  Same with Kobe Bryant or any great athlete.  All great athletes are focused on their progress.  
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If I have achieved greatness or close to it in any arena, it is by accident and a product of my focus on progress in that area.  I didn't want to be a great chess player.  I was just fascinated on if I could keep getting better.  By enjoying the progress, I have reached a higher level then I ever thought possible.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The area of progress I'd like to focus on right now is my physical activity and health.  I know I've been saying that for a while but I am losing weight and I also think focusing on progress is the key to getting where I want to be physically.
                    </p>

                        Sometimes my blog posts are not very good or well thought out, like my last one, and sometimes I'm just writing to write, or sharing a clip I found, like this one, as if it's a facebook status. (I don't have facebook right now).  But, other times I really have something important to share, and it is carefully planned and just dying to come out of me into the world.  I hope you enjoy those types of posts when you explore my blog.  A couple that come to mind are "Luciferianism 101" where I break down what satanists actually believe philosophically, and "Second Grade" where I stop trying to convince the reader of conspiracies and instead move on to what it all means if you actually embrace it.

                <h2>Energy</h2>
                <p>
                    I have a group text with 5 friends.  I started it the other day to share a video of the riots in Austrailia against lockdowns.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The group text is kind of a 3 on 3 and I want to use the word battle royale although that now refers to last man standing modes in video games.
                </p>
                <p>
                    3 of us are unvaccinated and against the covid vaccine.  The other 3 are vaccinated and for the vaccine.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It's truly an incredible disagreement because we're all friends and yet each 3 think the other 3 is completely wrong.  It's an uncrossable chasm between us, if we focus on it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    But it occured to me today that there are lies on both sides of the argument.  Like whichever way you go, you're stumbling in the dark.  The important thing is to rise about it and have a good attitude.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I think "vibes" and good energy are extremely important and powerful.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I think we have the ability to sense the energy of other people without them saying a world.
                </p>

                    When it comes to my disagreement with my friends, I'm open to the possibility that there exist two worlds simultaneously.  One where I'm right, and one where they're right.  We're somehow living in both worlds at the same time, and then the important think is how we behave.

                    I'm going to try to keep my energy up and good vibes going.  Can an apocolypse get you when you're in a good mood?  Can it even occur in your reality when you're vibing??  Don't things always seem to have a chain reaction.  You're at the best party, and the best song comes on, the girl you like comes in... or you're having the worst day ever, you're signif other breaks up with you, bad hair day, and a flat tire and your phone's dead?

                    These life events seem to have a sort of chain reaction and right now I'm actually pretty confident the asteroid cannot hit you from outer space if you're at the beach having fun.  Shit only seems to hit the fan when you go down that negative energy path.  Of couse this is just a wacky theory but I think we control our reality a lot more than science leads us to believe.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I've said before sometimes I close my eyes and decide how it's going to be before I go in somewhere and then it comes true.  Not everyone is slave to your thoughts but maybe you only deal with the versions of people that you bring into existance.  Like maybe there's 20 versions of me each day and if you're joking around you experience the joking version.  Meanwhile I'm having another experience.  I really think there's more to it than just objective reality, "I'm right you're wrong" type of science. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Maybe it's a group project.  We're all consciously creating a group experience, I don't know.  It doesn't seem to explain how impactful we can be when we really try to be.  I'm almost afraid of my own power.  If I really set my mind to something I can usually achieve it, but sometimes I don't even have the courage to do so.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Anyway I'm not even sure there's one correct way to look at things, so I'm not going to waste my time convincing people who don't want to be convinced, and I'm not even going to think I'm right and they're wrong.  I would like to be left alone when it comes to government mandates and guilting people into the vaccine, but I'm not going to focus on what I don't want to happen because that seems to bring it along faster.  I'm going to focus on what I do want to happen.  I'm going to use my power to put out good energy.  I'm going to bask in the good energy and think more about solutions than problems.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I get carried away talking about what I don't like.  I thought it was necessary to raise the alarm and point out the negative aspects to the things society is pushing towards.  But I think now the better strategy is to ring the bell on how great other things are.  I'm going to focus on what people are doing right, and bring more of that into society.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    I have so many great things to be thankful for in my life right now.  When I was in intensive therapy one of the things my therapist told me to do was list out 5 things I was grateful for every day.  It really does help.

                        I subscribed to this chick's channel because I once saw a video by her explaining the crisis of masculinity and I thought it was cool seeing a girl speak up in our defense.  
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I've actually already posted one of her videos on this website.  Now I see that she released a video about modern tyranny. 
                    </p>

                        Listen, if America wanted to take out the North Korean dictatorship we would eviscerate them.  The only reason a county like that can exist for so long without challenge is backing from seriously strong governments like China or the US.  North Korea is one big mind control experiment if you listen to King Yun Park's story of how she survived and escaped.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        North Korea isn't the exception.  It's the rule.  We're just less brainwashed here, but make no mistake, the majority of people even in the freeest country in the history of the world are brainwashed by their government.  
                    </p>

                        It really is scary when you can see it in action, creeping closer to your daily life.  It's even scarier when most people are oblivious to it.  However, when you really know what's going on, there is comfort in Jesus Christ.  There's simply no way to rationalize the evil pervading here without the influence of the devil or something supernatural.

                    <p>
                        Maybe you're waiting for me to provide proof of what I'm saying.  I suggest you go to the start of my blog when I was still interested in doing that or trying to convert the non-believers.  If you can't see the intrusion of government against it's own citizens in the last few years then you are truly blind.

                        Tyranny always comes in the name of something else. The Reign of Terror in the French Revolution was caused by none other than the "Commitee of Public Safety" and Maximilien Robespierre.  It's easier for them to make it seem like it was your idea to lock yourselves down.  The truth is they control all those celebrities who came out day one in support of social distancing, lockdowns, and business closures.  I would say they pay them, but it's almost more likely those creeps don't even need money, and are controlled by other means such as shapeshifters or aliens or demons.  I know that sounds like it's crazy but it's actually way more crazy to think this is all just people's natural response to covid.  This is a government power grab and control structure meant to last.  And everytime you think it's going away they just release new headlines and stats and stamp their foot down again.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        They control the press. They control the narrative.  They control the opposition.  They control the platforms on which you can discuss anything.  This website is purely me.  I make no money, in fact, I lose money doing this.  But I love the truth.  I am a slave to the truth and love.  I love Jesus Christ and God and I will not stand idly by as my freedom is taken away from me bit by bit.

                    <p>
                        The terrifying thing is that it will be regular people who try to take it from me.  They don't realize they're playing into the devil's hands by shaming the unvaccinated, or unmasked.  In the video I posted it stated how masking children in a classroom causes language and health problems.  Not only does the government not care about that, they actually prefer it.  They want more idiots to dominate.  The last thing they want is to have dominant literate articulate masculine men challenging their authority, especially those like me who have the ability to generate their own version of the press online.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I wish I had better news, I really do.  That's why I consistently bring up Jesus.  The evil is overwhelming and the only option of avoiding despair is having a personal relationship with your higher power, in my case Jesus, and trusting that relationship so you don't collapse in despair.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Forcing these restrictions and mandates onto children when they have no chance of dying from Covid is pure evil and by design.  It gets me fired up when they go after kids.  All I know is they are no match for my creator, and they will burn in hell the instant God deems it necessary.  God Bless.

                        You may have forgotten about David Icke because he's been censored from facebook and youtube, or maybe you consider him a crackpot because he used to talk about Reptilians, but if you make it through the cheesy ad at the beginning of this video, you realize he is a modern day einstein.  His description of reality is breathtaking.  He makes perfect sense.  He's eloquent.  It's just a shame people put him into a box when he actually is such an articulate and brilliant guy.

                        Last thing I want to say is about inner truth.  Sometimes my friends and I will get into arguments about information and disagreeing about what we should take away from it.  In the end of this Video David Icke points out the seperation of the mind from the spirit.  The mind is at the mercy of whatever information it's presented.  The spirit is not.  For example, let's say you have a little daughter.  She needs a baby sitter.  You interview a guy to babysit her but he creeps you out.  It doesn't matter how many statistics show you how he is the best babysitter and has the highest rating, or least likely chance to abuse her.  If he creeps you out, that's the end of it.  You don't need to dig into information, you intuitively would never let the creep watch over your daughter.  Similarly, it doesn't matter what covid info is released, I intuitively am creeped out by the government and media and don't care what they say,  I know intuitively I am okay to walk outside without a mask and shake a strangers hand and look him in the eye.  I know it.  You might say I'm blind or reluctant to take in new information and adjust but the truth is there are some things that are unmodifiable, like switching from being creeped out by a guy to letting him babysit your daughter.  No amount of contrary information from the press or 5 star reviews from his past clients will dissuade you of your inner truth.  And if it does, and he abuses your daughter, you'll never doubt yourself again.  I don't doubt myself, and I don't waste my time calculating carefully chosen manipulated information.  I know by inner truth it's okay to not get vaccinated and not wear a mask and not want to be locked inside by my government's mandate. Thanks, Max.

                    The foundation of a good fantasy football team is a Running back 1 and a running back 2.  They are the engine that drives the success of the team.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Modern Totalitarianism has 2 engines or "running backs" in this metaphor.  Terrorism, and Covid.  Covid is the RB2.  Terrorism, is the illuminati's bread and butter.  They use the threat of terrorism to go to war and spy on their own citizen and get away with whatever they want in the name of "NATIONAL SECURITY"
                </p>
                <p>
                    Covid, the RB2, is the other main way to gain power.  They use covid to take away our rights in the name of "PUBLIC SAFETY"
                </p>
                <p>
                    Then you have the Elite Wide Reciever 1, Big Pharma.  Big Pharma has half of the population popping pills everyday, believing they'd be worse off without them.  These masses are dependent upon the pills they're getting and they are basically afraid to face life without them.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This goes hand in hand with the WR2, Psychiatrists, who prescribe these medications and convince the masses they are mentally ill.  Then you have the bench wide receivers which would be other cogs in the wheel like lobbyists but that's not as important.
                </p>
                <p>
                    TE is the smart phones everyone carries around, with microphones, cameras, and location tracking technology that the government uses to spy on everyone, all of the time.  Not to mention the Alexas people put in their homes. "Big Data" could be another name for the tight end.  Also you have the added element of people staring at their phones all day.  I like my new google pixel, I'm just saying the Government likes it too.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Then the winning FLEX option is Pornography.  This quells the masses, especially men, and makes them impotent and easy to rule over.  None of us really feel like doing anything when porn is so easily accessible and is free in high-definition with barely any ads.  It's almost as if the government pays for it.  It's a nice way to mind control.
                </p>
                <p>
                    That is how Totalitarianism is going to try to win the championship.  If I had to construct a team that beats it it would be something like...
                </p>

                <h4>QB Jesus</h4>

                <p>
                    I forgot to mention, the quarterback of Totalitarianism's team is Mass Media and Hollywood and Social media and the fact that we are bombarded with propaganda and woke agendas that try to make men into women and women into men and good into bad and bad into good and upside down into right side up, etc.  They distort the truth with lies and try to make lies the truth.  They try to make light dark and dark light.  The only way to defeat this is by believing in God and spending time on your spiritual self whether it's asking questions or strengthening your faith.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Love and Freedom are the driver's of the resistance.

                <h2>Revisiting Monster's Inc</h2>
                <img class="picfloat" src="static/img/monstersinc.jpg" alt="minc">
                <p>I haven't seen Monster's Inc since I learned Satan was running the world.  Hear me out.  Disney+ let's you stream Pixar movies and they've updated the animation in them.</p>
                <p>
                    I put on Monster's Inc just to have a good time, because I remember liking it, but I enjoy watching it with a certain lense, looking for "truth drops" as the youtuber quantum of conscience would say.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    I look for hidden meaning, and symbolism.  Opening scene it's 6:00 o clock, the main character wakes up and has devil horns, and his friend is one big eyeball.  The Devil horns are a shoutout to the devil and the eyeball guy is a representation of the all-seeing eye.  Couldn't find the 3 6's.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Then we get into the plot and it reminded me of free energy and covid.  In the plot, the monster city is said to be powered by children's screams, so monsters are trying to scare kids just to take their energy.  The monsters also have been told by the CEO that children are extremely deadly and touching them is contagious and deadly.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The monsters go through different doors which act as portkeys and take them to the real world.  One day a monster goes through and comes back with a sock on his back.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    Everyone freaks out about the sock and an alarm goes off and the CDA (CDC) comes in to isolate and destroy the contaminant.  It's comedic and complete overkill.  The kids are not even contagious.  The CEO just wants his employees to believe they are contagious so he can keep his scam going. His scam is that a children's laughter can power 1000x more than their scream, but if that secret gets out he won't make any money from his corporation because it will be basically free energy for the whole town with one laugh.  That is a truth drop because it's why we run on gas and they hide free energy from us.  There's no money in free energy for all.  There's lots of money in gas.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The other truth drop is how they treat the monster who had the sock on him, and how they treat the child who escapes into the monster world.  They shave the fur off the monster and give him a shower like in a zombie movie.  They disrespect him and leave him naked in front of everyone and then leave.  That's how people can be treated if we let covid policing go too far.  Loss of human dignity in the name of stopping the spread of a contagion.  And it's all based on a lie.  
                </p>
                <img class="picfloatverysmall" src="static/img/monsterposter.jpg" alt="disney">
                <p>
                    When the girl comes into the monster universe all the monsters have been so brainwashed that they run away screaming...  They've been conditioned by lies to the point of ridiculousness.  A little girl saying "boo" terrifies them even though they're big scary monsters.  This is like people being afraid of a handshake, hug, or an unmasked unvaccinated person sharing a room with them.  Or even someone with Covid.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Am i saying they knew back then about covid, and monster's inc is predictive programming?  Maybe.  I mean the Child Disinfeciton Agency is clearly a play on the CDC and the scream/laugh dynamic is pretty clearly a reference to the free energy conspiracy.  
                </p>
                <p>And look who made it.  Disney.  If anyone's capable of putting out predictive programming, it's them.</p>
                <p>Also the entire idea of a world we can't see feeding off our negative energy is perfectly reasonable to me, so the setup to this movie may be a metaphysical truth.  Lastly, Mike's love interest is a reference to Medusa and they love their Gods and Goddesses.</p>

                    You really can't feel good about ARob until Fields takes the job from Dalton.  Meanwhile you have Dhop drama with the vaccine and Thielen may also struggle with Kirk Cousins coming out against the vaccine.  I hate to say this but it's hard for me to imagine a qb coming out against the vaccine and then having a great year.  The system we're inside of chews people up and spits them out when they say a bad thing about the vaccine.

                <p>
                    DeAndre Hopkins deleted his tweet about contemplating retirement and replaced it with a cryptic tweet, "Freedom?". He wanted to retire because he didn't want to hurt his teammates by having them forfeit games because the nfl rules are different for vaccinated vs. unvaccinated players.  Let me decrypt that tweet for you.  He posted on social media about how he doesn't want to take the vaccine and then he got a call from his agent or someone from the team saying... Take that down.. or "we've deleted that tweet you sent out, here's why..."  Deandre learned that his opinion is not welcome on this matter and he should shut his fucking mouth, so he said, "Freedom"? questionging freedom's very existence because we are not free anymore as we have no freedom of speech.  We only have freedom of politically correct speech.  People are censored left and right, including myself from youtube on multiple occassions with multiple accounts.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I just want to say that the entire idea of having a legal document stating how unvaccinated persons will be treated differently from vaccinated persons is a very dangerous and unfair distinction.  I understand it's done under the pretense of safety and logistics but the reality is we've created two new subclasses of people.  The "Vaxxed" and the "Unvaxxed".  This will inevitably lead to discrimination and conflict and is an evil idea or a stupid one.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If the vaccine was safe and effective they wouldn't need to say that every 5 seconds.

                    Ask the league lawyer what he thinks but I think any law that makes distinctions between unvaccinated individuals and vaccinated individuals is a dangerous precident for discrimation.  It will lead to medical tyranny, where you have to "Take your joy" like in the brilliant indie game "We Happy Few"  You don't want to live in a world where you're ordered to take certain medicines.  That's a dictatorship.

                <p>
                    I'm watching the Karate Kid right now.  Haven't seen it in 10+ years.  Jonathan Adampants used to make videos about it so I know it contains some important truths.  I've decided I'm going to draft Davante Adams and name my team Davante Adampants.  I also want to learn karate.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I've been so frustrated lately.  I think part of it is not being able to sleep in my room and having to sleep on the couch while the carpet is replaced.  But honestly I've been having trouble with my emotions lately even before that.  I'm glad I have emotions, sometimes I feel like there's zombies around me wearing masks out of choice and popping Anti-Depressants every day.  At least I have emotions, but now I need a way to channel them.  I know physical activity is necessary but I keep avoiding the gym.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My mom is a black belt and I've taken a few karate classes before.  I remember what it was like.  I think I could use that structure.  Too bad everyone's such a moron with masks.  Maybe I'll just train myself.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm so angry all of the time.  As compassionate as I am at times toward humanity and the homeless and other people, part of me hates them for their ridiculous beliefs.  Not only are most people completely insane, but they think I'm the one who's insane for not wanting to wear a mask or take a vaccine.  People think Chick-fil-a was never chic-fil-a for me and I'm just "misremembering" or it's "not important".  It honestly pisses me off.  I really think excelling in a physical art like karate and harnessing my competetive spirit could do wonders for my mental health.  Joe Rogan often talks about martial arts.  I'm not sure Karate is the one I will like the most but I'd love to explore the martial arts while I'm still young.  29 ain't too old.  I also think the process of weekly classes could encourage me to lose weight.

                <p>In my last post I blamed myself for the smell but it's clear now that it's some sort of dead animal inside of my bedroom wall.  I am going to use this experience to never take scent for granted again.  I have vowed to myself to keep my bedroom henceforth smelling like a paradise.  I slept on the couch last night and I have given up trying to spruce up the smell.  I need the apartment people to come in and fix it.  I'm basically living in the living room now, but the girls are out of town so it's not a big deal.</p>

                    I just went 35-0 in Call of Duty: Cold War.  I've gone 35-0 before with an MP7 in MW3.  This is with an MP5 and the Carv Tactical Rifle.  It's a pretty dominant combination as you'll see.  Putting music to this will be difficult because youtube is an asshole.  I actually have to use bitchute for pretty much everything now whether it's a call of duty montage or a conspiracy video.  They removed my last video called "Vaccine Treason"

                    New song...  my room smells terrible and I'm trying to make it smell better.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I washed everything and threw everything else out.  I am leaving the windows open and febreezing... it's interesting the metaphysical implications of getting rid of a bad smell.  It's kind of like how darkness and light are often talked about.  Light expels dark and dark is the absense of light.  The bible talks about this often, how the evil people love the dark and how god will bring everything into light in judgment.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Getting rid of a bad smell is different.  It's not as simple as light.  I have to find the root of the smell, and get rid of whatever is actively causing it. (like a wet towel)  Then I have to allow the stale air to escape out the window.  Then I have to install an air freshener and walk around febreezing.  It's so bad.  It's starting to smell a little better because I have done everything I could possibly think of.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    I got rid of my air mattress and went back to sleeping on the floor.  I think the air inside the mattress was one of the causes.  I put all my towels out of my room other than one that is hung up and 2 that are just washed and dried.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If I can't control my environment I can't control very much.  I at least smell good personally.  My guitar strings are new, they used to smell.  My longboard is new... my blanket is washed.  My carpet was just cleaned last week.  I really want to be able to control my environment before I expand outward.  I also want a good home to bring girls back to.  I'm so happy to have been alerted to the importance of scent.  I will never take it for granted again.  I hit some sort of threshold and now smell is super important to me and I can't wait until it smells fantastic in here.  I've worked hard on it all night other than hanging at the pool with my roomates sister tonight until the security guard kicked us out.  It's really amazing living here.  We even just got a brand new washer and drier installed so there's no reason I shouldn't be able to smell great and have a great smelling room.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Anyway, I'm just an idiot who can barely control the smell of his own room or self, and orders doordash to work when I'm at home.  That is the inspiration of the song.  PEACE

                    I really enjoy winning in chess and winning in call of duty.  These activities are extremely engrossign and competitive but also easy to do, thanks to online gaming.  If I want to play some one in my level in chess in real life I need to drive to Old Agoura to play this Russian who is better than me, or I'd have to travel to a tournament of some kind.

                <p>
                    With Call of Duty it's rare to have a friend as good as me and even then split screen is not as fun as online because there is screenlooking.

                <p>
                    I truly enjoy these 2 activities but I think I'd like to get good at something else.  I'm not actually the best ever in cod, I just had GOAT on my mind that day because of a Quantum of Conscience podcast I was listening to.

                <h2>Levels</h2>
                <p>
                    There's different levels of understanding reality.  I'm going to explain them.
                </p>
                <h4>
                    Level 1 - Fundamentalists
                </h4>
                <img class="picfloat" src="static/img/fundamentalism.jpg" alt="fundamentalism">
                <p>
                    Religious Fundamentalism is the 1st level of Truth.  It doesn't matter if they're Muslim, Christian, Catholic, Protestant, Jewish, Buddist, and any other.  All of these groups suffer from the same groupthink and logical fallacy of thinking everyone at their church is correct and everyone at the other place of worship is incorrect.
                </p>
                <p>
                    These types of groups lack the ability and opportunity to think critically.  They are buried in shame and do not ask obvious questions or address clear contradictions or counter-examples to their dogma.  These types of people lack the courage to wrestle with their own doubt, and cling to books and rely on preachers to guide them like sheep.  These are the types of folk who would donate large amounts to their church and even fall for indulgences back in the day (paying money to be forgiven of sin by the church)  Donating to support a church sounds harmless, benevolent even, but this is only within the first level of understanding.
                </p>
                <h4>Level 2 - Atheists</h4>
                <img class="picfloat" src="static/img/atheists.png" alt="atheism">
                <p>
                    Athiests have the good sense to run away from level 1 fanatics.  They want no part of religion.  They're well aware of the lack of critical thinking within fundamental religion and see themselves as above those equally mistaken groups, and they are indeed above them.  An athiest will actually examine the logical structure of religious belief.  They use their brains and actively pick the bullshit apart.  Bravo.  Congratulations on passing to level 2 of God's game you're playing, but there's much more.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If an athiest walks into a person with a level of understanding above them they will actually confuse them with a level one person.  The true athiest sees himself or herself at the top, just like the level 1 people do.  In fact, Athiests are equally as dogmatic as fundamentalists in thier athiesm.  These typical athiests could all congregate into a church, or a subreddit and participate in group think.  The critical thinking applies to their inspection of fundamental religions, but it doesn't apply to themselves within their own belief in no God.  They insist there is no God. They give God no credit, and they bring great trouble upon themselves when they do.  They're eager to convert you, just like the fundamentalists.  Their critical thinking exists, but it's limited and they suffer from the same characteristics as the fundamentalists and lack originality or substance.  An athiest person is a religious person. Atheism is a religion at war with itself, in denial of it's own existance.
                </p>
                <h4>Level 3 - Agnostics</h4>
                <img class="picfloat" src="static/img/agnostic.png" alt="agnostic">
                <p>
                    Agnostics admit that they don't have all the answers.  Maybe there is a God, maybe there isn't.  There is more nuance and variation in this group and less vitriol.  By admitted they do not know, agnostics open themselves up to potential truths.  By not projecting their fixed beliefs onto the world, they can have an occassional glimpse into true reality.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    Agnostics gathered in a group would have more stimulating conversation on religous topics, because they are able to ask questions and more focused on the quality of the question then the quality of their own answers to use as weapons the way atheists do to the fundamentalists.  Also these Agnostics are more likely to switch between levels, whereas the other groups are less fluid.  One agnostic may have never really thought about it, and another might have read all the holy books and athiest books and still can't make up his mind...  both are level 3 technically, but the educated one's refusal to decide is more profound.  But we're not done yet.

                    Level 4 - Truthers

                    When a person isn't satisfied on their quest for truth they progress through 1,2, and 3.  But they cannot rest at 3.  They swing wildly from belief to belief, trying on different ones like outfits at a shopping mall.  They play and play and search and search for the perfect fit.  It takes years.  Eventually they end up in a youtube rabbit hole and learn that everything is upside down.  They learn that the level 1 people have been fed partial truths to hook them into a lie.  And same goes for each level up to 4.  There is truth in Fundamentalism, Atheism, and Agnosticism, but not enough for the truth to get his fill.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    After alienating most their friends and family the truther realizes that one of the fundamental religions warns of this:  Christianity.  True Christianity starts to occur to the truther.  He left christianity behind when he graduated from level 1 to 2, but now at 4 he has to reexamine what he left behind with a critical lens of both 1 and the 2 he went into.  He makes sure he didn't throw the Baby Jesus out with the bathwater.
                </p>
                <h4>
                    Level 5 - Uniqueness
                </h4>
                <img class="picfloatsmall" src="static/img/mjnew.jpg" alt="mj">
                <p>
                    Level 5 is when the truther stops searching for truth outwardly and starts to instead turn inward and rediscover his or herself.  This results in an overflow of creativity and productivity, like this website, kapeash?

                <p>It's refeshing watching something new... for some reason I find myself rewatching things, reluctant to try something new.  But 1st Man, the youtuber I've been following, has videos about Thomas Shelby's body language.  He also analyzes Ragnar from Vikings.  I love Ragnar, but I had never heard of Thomas Shelby, so I thought I'd check it out.  Cilian Murphy is a great actor and just starred in a Quiet Place part 2.  He's also in a bunch of Christopher Nolan movies like inception, batman, and even Dunkirk.  I really like him in a leading role on a show and his character is badass.  I'm definitely going to keep watching and I'm glad I found a new show.</p>

                    Black Widow is a new movie out in theaters but also available via streaming.  Personally I went to the theaters before it was out so I had to settle for the first half of Fast 9 before I walked out.  For Widow, I choose to stream it using my <a href="https://www6.f2movies.to/watch-movie/black-widow-66666.4534076" target="_blank">free site</a>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Black Widow has a tremendous opening scene and an amazing song for the title credits.

                <p>
                    Olivia Rodrigo, pop star sensation, recently visited the White house seemingly mostly to push vaccinations to her fans.
                </p>
                <p>
                    First and foremost, Young people don't need to be vaccinated against Covid.  It doesn't even threaten them and actually brings great risk because it's experimental and unneccessary.  The Government is so hellbent on getting people to take this vaccine their actually weaponizing the most popular singer on Tik Tok right now.  I even like her!  I love her music and personality and listen to her album and think she's beautiful.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Putting her next to fauci is just like Pavlonian conditioning where you ring a bell before feeding a dog and the bell makes the dog salivate in the future.  If you train people to love Olivia Rodrigo and then put him with Fauci they will subconsciously love Fauci.
                </p>
                <p>
                    They could have used her to talk about serious issues like drug overdoses and homelessness, and low Testosterone.  My roommate was upset with me for not getting vaccinated.  He killed himself with drugs a month later.  People are completely blind to the real problems of the world.  He was overweight and killing himself and more concerned with me and the coronavirus than getting off drugs and onto a treadmill.  It's embarrassing.  It's ridiculous.  Olivia Rodrigo is a cutie, and I'm not mad at her.  I was watching closely and I'm still not convinced she was even aware of what's going on.  She might genuinely think she's helping.  She might also be an MK Ultra slave passed around at eyes wide shut parties.

                    I already knew she had a manager in the illuminati or whatever because of this picutre but she never opened her mouth about politics until now.  This picture is used as the thumbnail for youtube of her "sour photo shoot".  It's a picture of a photographer taking a picture of her.  The photographer's shirt and elbow are part of the shot making it look like a dick right next to her pretty face to get you to subconsciously click on the video.  Trust me.  I pity the children who will change their mind and receive an experimental jab because of her.  Crazy world.

                My friend has a theory about time and reality that I'll butcher now.  His name is Jokir.  He says that everything has already happened but God is letting you play a create your own adventure book of life.  You jump around to the version you choose to be consciously aware of.  Then, that version of yourself is basically the center of that universe.  But other people are the center of their own universes.  And when you interact with someone else.  You're talking to the version of them that matched the current version of you to collide with similar trajectories.  Like My roommate Adam might still be alive in his universe, but in my universe I was able to see him dead as a warning from God of what could become of me if I don't shape up.  It was exactly what I needed to see.  And then on the other timeline Adam could be living with the version of me who talked him into giving Jesus a chance and exercise and turning his life around.  You never know.

                The third truth drop is that Loki isn't evil.  He's just "weakness using illusion to create fear" as they say in the show.  Loki represents God's usage of Lucifer.  God uses the Devil to his advantage.  Without Loki, the Avengers never would have assembled so powerfully.  Similarly, God uses the Devil to make us strong.  If there was no adversary, we would be unfit for God's presence and kingdom after death.  But if we overcome the evil one, then we become worthy.

                <h2>Philosophy of Death and Dying</h2>
                <img class="picfloat" src="static/img/death.jpg" alt="death">
                <p>
                    Today I came home from work and found my roomate dead in his room.  He overdosed on Fentanyl.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm still processing it.  I called 911 and he is now out of the aparment.  They carried him out in a body bag.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There's nothing I could do.  He was purple.
                </p>
                <p>
                    He was 41.  He was a nice guy.  He was overweight.  He wasn't working.  He was waiting for school to start and said he was going to be a teacher.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I've lived with him for a couple months and have a decent grasp on his philosophies and I think they lead to his death.  I hope you guys really hear what I'm saying.  He didn't believe in God.  He didn't believe in excercise. He didn't believe in bettering himself.  He said he wanted to travel, but he never left the house.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    He had a test he could have studied for and passed but he was putting it off.  I found him dead with his laptop open, in his bed with a chick-fil-a still clutched in his hand.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It was one of the most traumatic experiences of my life.  Luckily I had just went to the gym after work before finding him and my endorphins shielded me.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm planning on going to an AA meeting tomorrow morning for some support.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    I hope someone out there can learn from this website and understand that there is a God, and these sinful ways ultimately lead to death.  He died sinning in multiple ways at once with drugs, gluttony, sloth, all that. He was by all standards a decent man.  But he died alone in his boxers in a humiliating way.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I feel like God put me here to witness his self-destruction.  I couldn't have stopped it.  I had just bought him pizza the other day to lure him from his room and he thanked me.  I think I prolonged his life as long as I could.  The cops told me he had a history of overdosing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Life is short.  It's crazy because I just made a <a href="https://youtu.be/sMycI3FgdkI">video</a> about calling 911 and then I had to call them a week later.  Also I've been listening all week to this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCR3RmB3DNZvML6I_bGJ3l4g">youtube channel</a> I posted below about being a successful man.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    Adam and I disagreed about many things.  And as opposite as we are, I'm also similar to him.  He has shown me where the path I was on leads.  I've let myself get overweight, but nowhere near that.  I'm not even 30 yet.  I have some time.  But life is short.  Men must strive to improve themselves and set goals and have systems.  He was just fucking around and got himself killed.  It was an accident on purpose.
                </p>
                <p>
                    All I can say is I'm glad I have Jesus in my life and constantly wrestle with these big thoughts and quesitons about life.  I know my purpose and where I'm going and what's required of me to achieve greatness.  It's not a shock to me that Adam didn't believe in God, got vaccinated, supported black lives matter and calling singular people "they" if they want to be called that.  You might think that has nothing to do with it, but I'm just saying he went along with what Society wanted him to think, and now he's dead.  He had no strong opinions of his own that contradict society.  And that is what makes the man.  He lost the game of life.  He died alone in his underwear in a pile of blood and throwup.  I'm not goign to lose.  I'm going to win.  I'm going to be a winner and it's never been more clear to me how life and death this mindset is for a man to have.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Don't let yourself go.  Grab life by the fucking horns and thank God for creating you, and read the occasional bible verse and show some fucking graditude and respect.
                </p>

                <p>Also just want to say... The most obvious advantage to reality exploration as opposed to simulation exploration is that you never know what you might find.</p>
                <p>
                    However, if the simulated world has generative abilities, and I can create a map for you to visit, there may actually be more to visit and discover in the simulated universe.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The reality > simulation advantage of realism could become negligable.  The stakes are always going to be higher in reality because death is truly game over.  But that is both a pro and a con.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The religious aspect of missing out on God's creations of nature is the last remaining pro of reality.  However, God hasn't shown up in a while and it could be possible that he fully intends us to have enough space given to create our own simulated space.  We can take what we know from God's creations and put them into a simulation.  Maybe not exactly, but maybe that is possible to do.  You could even have babies in a simulation and raise them and they could be self aware simulated persons.  That's probably what we are already anyway, idk.

                <p>Years ago I deleted a rap I made and I'm thankful I remembered it and was able to just rerecord it because I like it a lot and I shouldn't be self conscious.  It's the best I can do!  I think this song has a spot for a quick verse and the verse is about me coming back after a break from xbox live and also about conspiracy theories and how people hate me for them.  In my last post Yeonmi Park talked about how she fears being assassinated in such a way that it looks like suicide.  I can relate to that and that's what my rap was about so I recreated it.  Enjoy!</p>

                <p>I clicked on this youtube video because I follow Lex Fridman because he talks about Artificial Intelligence a lot.  I had heard about a new woman leader in North Korea and I thought this might be her.  That shows you my level of ignorance.  This girl is actually a survivor who survived by getting sold into sexual slavery to china.  Being a sex slave was a step up from north korea and she I guess was eventually able to escape and now she's on Lex's podcast sharing her story.  It makes me almost tear up and it's really incredible to hear her story.  It makes me want to do something about North Korea.  I make a lot of noise about the lack of freedom in America but we have more freedom here than anywhere else in the world.  I live an incredibly blessed life and want to help people from the atrocities of tyranny.  I only criticize America because I view freedom and liberty as fragile and imperative to monitor.  We must be vigilant and guard freedom.  And we must liberate North Korea.  She makes the point that it's more important than space travel and I agree.  How can we not save all those people?  It's embarrassing.  Jeff Bezos and Bill Gates should be ashamed of themselves with all their agendas.  This poor girl is angry that no brilliant minds have figured out a way how to end her people's suffering.  Our military should be embarassed if we can't figure out a way to invade without letting them set off a nuke.  We should laser beam their leaders from space and storm in there with water and food and rehabilitation programs of the kindest possible nature.</p>

                    I spend too much time worrying about my place in the world and how people will think of me or if I'll ever find love again.  But the truth is I'd be much happier if I could rescue these people and show them all the possibility life has.  We should not allow these atrocities in North Korea to continue.

                    This Youtuber has reached out to me multiple times.  His most recent comment was warning me about Quantum of Conscience but the comment has been mysteriously deleted.  I viewed his latest video and it's blowing my mind.  I knew this technology existed and I already posited that bots were on the internet posing as people in my <a href="https://youtu.be/d2A09iidkTs">whiteBloodCell</a> video, but I didn't know it was out in the open like this on reddit.

                    Alan Turing was a computer scientist who came up with a test to determine the sophistication of a computer.  The test is simple.  A human being interacts with a computer by text chat.  If the human being cannot tell if it is a bot he is talking to, the test is passed.  Well, ladies and gentlemen, the test has officially been passed with Open AI's GPT-2 or whatever.  Turing said that when this test is passed, artificial intelligence has arrived. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    GPT-2 can generate text posts and comments and pass as human.

                    Before I get into that, I want to share this video between Sadhguru and Matthew McConaughey.  I have always enjoyed Sadhguru's philosophy.  He is a happy guru capable of providing groundbreaking perspective shifts.  Matthew is a terrific actor.  His roles in Interstellar and True Detective are spectacular, and his philosophy and commencement speeches as himself are equally as tremendous.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The key point of this talk I want to highlight is when Sadhguru talks about "Selfishness".  He says "Selflessness" is an illusion because we can only perceive from a sense of self.  Even during ego death when I took salvia I was concerned primarily with who I was, my own powerlessness and lack of identity and fear.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    He goes on to explain that selfishness must extend to all things.  Instead of only caring about yourself but not others, he suggests you could extend your circle of selfishness to the whole planet or universe.  Why not want what's best for all things?  
                </p>
                <p>
                    The beauty of this generous selfishness and applying self-interest to all beings is that even when we have that benevolent goal we have a weighted ability to change ourselves more than another individual or system.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In other words, and this is my interpretation and extrapolation of what he said, The surest way to change the world is to change ourselves.  We have more control over ourself than anything else, so the most efficient way to heal the world is to heal yourself.  That's where we have influence.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Imagine a king of a country who's goal is to save endangered species.  He could command conservation efforts in his own kingdom and his commands will be obeyed, or he could venture out into another land and try to save the animals there.  When he goes to the other land, he is no longer King, his commands are ignored, and his impact is limited.  The wise king would use his position as king in his kingdom to leverage his power in his domain to save the most animals.

                <p>
                    You are the king of yourself.  What you say ultimately goes when it comes to what you do with your life.  I am the king of myself.  It would be wise for me to concentrate my efforts where I have the most influence.  By focusing on changing myself I can have the largest impact on the world because I am part of the world.

                <h4>Special Priviledges for the Fully Vaccinated </h4>
                <p>
                    Now, unfortunately I have to address this stupid issue.  When the government lifts its petty mandates and restrictions for the "fully vaccinated" that is really just reverse discrimination of the "unvaccinated."  Imagine a Martian king a million years ago on Mars.  He has partial control, as a president.  He is power hungry.  The Martians have liberty, so he comes up with a plan to take it away.  
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Create a Crisis</li>
                    <li>Declare Emergency Powers</li>
                    <li>Have Martian Celebreties paid to encourage the masses to obey</li>
                    <li>Take away civil rights like the right to wear whatever you want on Mars</li>
                    <li>Introduce a solution to the public for a way out on your terms</li>
                    <li>Slowly grant the lost rights back to only those to obey with your plans</li>
                    <li>Segregate out and socially cripple the Martians who do not comply</li>
                    <li>Make it so the rebels have no viable way to thrive within your kindom, and reign</li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    The way it would work on Earth in the biblical prophecy is:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Take away buying power of citizens</li>
                    <li>Give it back only to those who get the mark of the beast</li>
                    <li>Make it impossible to resist your control.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    By setting the standard of an "Honor System" to enforce the laws that say the fully vaxed doesn't have to live by the same rules as the unvaxxed... the implication of this is that someone unvaxxed, who doesn't wear a mask, is dishonorable.  They're making a normal sovern being into a dishonorable lying contagious risk to society.  Individual Sovergnty is their only enemy.  They just disguise it as an attempt to secure public safety, as usual.
                </p>
                <p>
                    People in a free country should be allowed to be free!  Think about this:  Why is a non-vaccinated person not required to wear a red shirt that says "I am not vaccinated.  Please stand 6 feet away for your own safety."  What is preventing that order?  Our Freedom?  That didn't seem to stop what's happening now.  If the non-vaxxed have to wear masks while the vaxxed don't, then by walking around with a mask people are announcing their private medical information.  It's not far off from a government approved dress code shirt with large font saying "Stay Away, I may be asymptomatic".  
                </p>
                <p>
                    Priviledges for the fully vaccinated == Discrimation of the non-vaccinated.

                    Having a water fountain for white people only, is the same thing as discrimating non-white people.  I fully understand that this is all being done under the pretense of protection against the boogey man (infectious invisible virus).  However, when tyranny comes, it tip-toes, and it doesn't tell you the truth of what it's doing.  The date-rapist at the bar does not come up to you in the name of rape.  He will lie and wait for the right moment to slip something into your drink.  And we, Americans, are getting date-raped by the government.

                <p>I view the Bible as required reading in the class of life.</p>
                <p>
                    It doesn't mean I want to read it, but it means I have to if I want to pass the class.  I at least have to pay attention in class or read the cliff's notes.  Otherwise, my teacher may not be so forgiving when I try to turn a 79 into a B- at the end of the schoolyear.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Any respectable atheist or agnostic intellectual will at least have a cursory understanding of the bible.  So I watched this video.  It talks about the general idea most people have about what Christians believe, vs. what the bible actaully says.  I think this guy does a really good job at humbling himself and acknowledging that the story of the bible is much more complex than the ways people have tried boiling it down.
                </p>
                <img class="picfloatverysmall" src="static/img/branch.jpg" alt="branch">
                <p>
                    He draws on a chalkboard a diagram that shows a person living their life on the way to a verdict of either heaven or hell, which is the popular consensus of what people think Christians believe, and then he dismantles that argument.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Although there are some parts of the bible that mention seperating the wheat from the tares, Jesus says on Earth, "Repent.  The Kingdom of Heaven is at hand".  In other words, Jesus says Heaven is on Earth with him at that moment.  They overlap.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Then this guy uses a ven diagram in a video to illustrate that concept.  What I want to talk about is his analysis of Jesus as a physician.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    We as people may detest child molestors and villians of that sort, however, we try to catch them in the act, or after the fact, and throw them behind bars to physically prevent them from hurting others.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Jesus, however, tries to address the root of the problem.  Lust.  It is the desire to exploit others for one's own pleasure that creates the problem in the first place.  We have a society where we have largely agreed we should let children turn 18 before we can engage in acts that bring ourselves pleasure.  The crime is that some people are not willing to wait for the sake of the mental health of the child.  Some people are lustful to the point where it doesn't matter how it affects the object of their lust.  They just want pleasure for themselves.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Lust itself is the root issue.  If there was no lust in the hearts of men, no underage girls would be in danger of someone violating them at a young age.  The men would simply wait until they were old enough.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    So the incredibly evil systems of child trafficking or sex trafficing of any kind spawns from the seeds of lust in the average man.  Because without the lust inside of us, none of that evil would be possible.  
                </p>
                <img class="picfloat" src="static/img/heath.jpg" alt="joker">
                <p>
                    Even if we put the rapist behind bars, the problem remains strong if he still wants to rape.  If the Joker breaks into Arkham Asylum and lets all the criminals loose on Gotham, all that truly matters is the hearts and minds of those men.  If those men have all found Jesus and rid themselves of their lustful ways then they aren't a menace to society or Gotham City.  If they still feel the same way, then they are a menace.  So I love the idea of Jesus attacking the root of the problem, and seeing how these evil inklings exist in all of us.  Some are just more out of balance than others.
                </p>
                <p>
                    And if someone has themselves been abused as a child, they may be more willing to abuse another child later on because in a twisted sense, why should they get to hold onto their virginity when I didn't get to?  Why should I respect their rights to their bodies when my own rights were trampled?  It's like burning someone else's toy car because yours was burnt and you can't bear the sight of someone else getting to play with a toy car when you lost yours.  I don't know.  I was never abused, but that's just a theory.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So anyway, Jesus recognized that the evil deeds eventually done are spawned from very basic roots of evil.  Jesus brought heaven to earth and kicked out the hell.  That's why he constantly cast demons out of people.  The idea is that Earth has Heaven and Hell overlays, and your hellish reality can be cured by Jesus.  Also, God created Heavens and the Earth, but it was Man that perhaps participated in the creation of Hell.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    Heaven has to be optional.  Otherwise, it isn't heaven.  See, a party that you HAVE to go to is no fun.  A party is only fun if you get to choose to go or not, and it's especially fun if you were specifically invited, or even helped plan it.  Trust me, I know a thing or two about parties.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When I say "Get the hell out of here!" I mean it literally.  I don't mean you should leave.  I mean you should take the hell in your life caused by sin, and get it out of here with the help of Jesus who can cast out the demons in your heart.  It was us, human beings, that killed Jews in Nazi Germany.  It was us, human beings, that abused black people in slavery.  And it was us, human beings, who abused children by the thousands.  It was us who killed Jesus Christ.  One of my favorite quotes by Jonathan Adampants that made me buy into him so much is when he said, quoting Jesus, " "Forgive them for they know not what they do." Why do you think you didin't know what you were doing?"  Adampants in that quote is implying that you yourself now are guilty of the same sin that killed God himself in the flesh.  Staggeringly brilliant delivery of the most important truth.  It is us, that is the problem.  We all possess all the "sparks" necessary for something like child trafficking to become a thing.  It's not a few rogue sickos, it's systemic.  We all have within us the desire to exploit others for our own personal pleasure, and that's just the worst intantiation of that fundamental sin.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I myself watch porn.  If I didn't have lust in my heart, I wouldn't watch it.  If I didn't watch it, it wouldn't get made.  If everyone stopped watching porn, there would be less incentive to make it.  Then girls lives wouldn't be exploited.  Maybe some like porn but there are plenty of girls that would be better off without that industry in my opinion.  Even men would be better off.  My point is, I participate in it.  I fan the flames of lust and help grow it into it's worst instantiations like trafficking. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    My sins are abundant, rampant, disgusting.  But at least I do the required reading, so when I have a failing grade towards the end of the semester, I can go in on my lunch and beg the teacher for some extra credit.  And luckily for us, our teacher is merciful.

                    I'm on a new chapter of the book of my life.  I'm the main character, and I'm the co-author along with God.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I just moved.  I am renting another room.  It is closer to my work and I have kitchen priveledges.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My parents are being very supportive.  They helped me get a lexus when my Mustang was breaking down, and they helped me get this room.  I'm mostly paying for everything myself though.

                    My sister, however has blocked me on whatsapp and I have no other way to reach her because she lives in Canada.  She blocked me after reading this blog and accusing me of sounding like an incel who's going to shoot up a school.

                    So, she gives me the worst insult of all time haha, and I'm the one who gets blocked?  I would never block her.  That's not my style.

                    They say you should keep a journal, go back and read it and learn from yourself.  Personally, I don't really keep a journal because I like to share what I create.  If this is the only journal I get, then at least I have one.

                    There is a line in one of my favorite movies "The Social Network" where Mark's gf says about his blog, "As if every word that came tumbling out of your mind was so clever it would be a crime not to share it".  In the words of Dewey Cox, Guilty as charged.

                <p>
                    My life's pretty good if I'm not comparing it to other people or my past.  And it depends on which person or which version of myself I'm comparing myself to anyway.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Even if right now I don't have certain things I use to have going for me, there is an element of financial independence I've never had before.

                    I am done with school, basically.  I have my college degree and a coding certificate.  All I have to do is my job.  Other than that I have lots of free time to literally do whatever I want.

                <p>
                    So there is so much new territory to explore.  I've never before had the ability to buy my own furniture and fill up an unfurnished room.  I bought a chair at Target for $200 which is absurd but I'm sitting in it right now and I love it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm really happy in my new spot.  Things are looking up.

                    Well, basically that there are spiritual elemends to life going on.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There are evil plans in motion and mass deception and brainwashing.

                    I really like Quantum of Conscience's ongoing perspective about how the truth community needs to move on.

                <p>
                    Step 1 is convincing yourself that the conspiracies are real
                </p>
                <p>
                    Step 2 is trying to convince others that they are real.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Step 3 is realizing that convincing others is borderline impossible.
                </p>
                <p>Step 4 is realizing that the level of deception is supernatural and reality itself is involved is the mass deception.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Step 5 is regaining yourself that you lost during the rabbit holes.

                <p>
                    I'm on step 5.  I'm not going to spend my days arguing with people.  You either see the Mandela Effect or you don't.  You either see the lies in the news or you don't.  I'll say my piece every now and then and I'm willing to discuss it with someone able to have a controversial conversation.

                <p>
                    It is fascinating that such intelligent successful people around me do not recognize what I recognize.  The simplest explanation of that is that I'm just a crazy person seeing things that aren't there.

                <p>
                    However, it's not that simple.

                    In Star Wars, The Darth Maul Trilogy ,there is a Senator who convinces the queen to elect a new chairman.  The Senator ends up getting nominated and winning.  He planned the whole thing.  Then he gets control of the senate, and gives himself emergency powers to deal with the current war.  The war is one he is secretly orchestrating.

                    I'm not reaching either, I can do this with virtually any media.  I can show you and explain the hidden meanings.  Anyway, the Evil Emperor ends up using "Order 66" to have all the clones of the Jedi Army turn on the Jedi and kill them for trying to undermine his power.  Why it wasn't order 666 is really just to make it slightly more subtle.

                    I was also watching John Wick Chapter 2 recently and I thought to myself, "I wonder what Illuminati symbolism they put in this movie."  Sure enough, when he's killing a few guys with a pencil.  One of the guys has a huge all-seeing eye tatooed on his hand and the Camera focuses on it for a couple of seconds.  To the average man, how do you explain these movies having this symbolism basically every single time?
                </p>
                <img class="picfloat" src="static/img/wick2.png" alt="wick">
                <p>
                    Why does it seem to be a contractual obligation, that there isn't a movie out there without blatant illuminati symbolism? The Death Star itself looks like an Eye.  A person could say I'm reading too much into things but really, You could pick any major movie or form of media, even a restaurant logo, out of a hat and I could show you the illuminati connection. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    In English Class it was drilled into us that when reading a book we should understand the symbolism the author put in there.  Many people would complain, "It doesn't always have to mean something!  It's just a green light at the end of Gatsby's dock, so what?"
                </p>
                <p>
                    For some reason, education wanted us to understand that none of these things are by accident.  Do you honestly think the guy getting killed by a pencil in John Wick having an all-seeing eye on his hand for the camera is not purposeful?
                </p>

                    If I'm streaming a movie, and it's buffering, like Spiderman the other day, I see illuminati symbols on the businesses Mary Jane is walking by just before she gets mugged.  It's something you can't even see unless you pause it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There is more to this life than people realize.  It's not nothing.  I'm not making it up.  It just is.  For some reason, these movies are required to have that sort of symbolism.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It's in music, news, movies, books, everything.  The truth leaks out of all media.  Some of the predictive programming for 9/11 is so outrageous it almost has to be supernatural.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    I don't have all of the answers.  I try to educate myself from the teachings of Jesus, and I try to focus on mastering myself.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It's not fun having people think I'm somehow less intelligent than them or crazy.
                </p>
                <p>
                    One of the reasons I'm fascinated by competeitions like Chess, Video Games, or Sports, is that if I'm able to win, then how can I be so wrong?  Like if I can get into the top 1000 players on lichess.org, which I did this year, then how come I get laughed at for thinking the monopoly man had a monacle?
                </p>
                <p>
                    If I wasn't so dominant in these objective measures of skill, I would have an easier time believing I'm wrong and other people are right.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Someone recently said to me about the Mandela Effect, you think you're right and the rest of the world is wrong.  Like you can either change your opinion to agree with the rest of the world, or you can declare the whole world wrong and yourself correct.  And he's right.  But it's even worse than that.  It's not just that I'm right and everyone else is wrong.  It's that reality itself is also wrong.  As in, Salma Hayek has always been Salma Hayek in this reality.  There was never Selma Hayek.  Pikachu never had a black tail, and Chick-fil-et was never Chic-fil-a.  So not only do I have to say that I disagree with everyone else, but I have to also disagree with all the evidence this reality shows that backs up the false story of this false reality.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It's a tall order.  But there's no going back.  And I love talking about the Mandela Effect because it's not too dark but it's equally as important as something like 9/11.  The same people who can't see 9/11 can't see The Mandela Effect, it seems to me.  9/11 and events like it have death and destruciton and fear.  But with Mandela effects, it's sometimes just a harmless dash on a kit kat that's missing, but it's just as significant as 9/11 being an inside job.

                <p>
                    So, yes I believe in the Mandela Effect.  I believe the past has changed to match the present that has also changed.  I don't care about observable lies when I have unobservable truth.  Shout out to Jonathan Adampants for that lesson.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    It doesn't matter if my reality confirms what I know deep within my soul.

                <p>
                    I'm just gonna make my games, songs, websites, and montages and have fun with my life.  And I don't care about socities definition of success.  Why should I have to have a pretty girlfriend all of the time?  Maybe I should view the times in my life when I do have a pretty girlfriend as a very special priveledge, and not something that's owed to me, or that ruins my life if I don't have it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I don't care what other people think.  It's my own thoughts that are in my head, that haunt me or bless me.  I'm the one who knows the truth about myself.  I know if I'm a good person or a bad person.  And I got to tell you, I'm not sure if I get to go to Heaven.  I'm not that great.  But I put in a decent amount of effort.  I try to be original and make my mark on this world, and help others when I can.

                    My last video got a comment.  It was someone named Joe very eloquently defusing my argument and telling me I need mental help.  Thanks, Joe, I've had my share of mental help, and I'm all set.  Ironically I recently made a <a href="https://youtu.be/uEFSrZ4LYYg">video</a> discussing a hypothetical Joe with an IQ of 90 who believes Space X is real.  Apparently he has manifested himself in my reality.  If you want to see our conversation, you can click on the video below I made called <a href="https://youtu.be/iywtzUQvgk4" target="_blank">FakeX</a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Joe makes some good points that I concede on, but he fails to see the bigger picture.  When I say "Dragon" is satanic, it sounds crazy in a vacuum.  But Look at the logo of Nasa Itself, I'm not pulling it out of thin air, it's right in front of your face and you cannot see it.  It's spiritual blindness and I can predict that Joe doesn't believe in Jesus, because if he did, he would be able to see wickedness.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The official explanation for nasa's red forked tongue in their logo is "a v shaped wing representing aeronautics"
                </p>
                <p>
                    Really?  Why's it red then? No Reason?  Just because there exists an official explanation does not make something true.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For example, if the pool guy is banging your wife while you're at work, and you come home and ask why he's there, they may offer you an official explanation.  "Well you see here, it's the official policy of our pool guys to come into the house and check the plumbing because we're also plumbers and your wife here was helping me out in your bedroom bathroom and that's why I'm up here with her."
                </p>
                <p>
                    People lie.  Nasa is comprised of people, best case scenario.  And Nasa Lies.  Everyone lies.  Apple lies about why their company is named apple and their logo has nothing to do with the garden of eden.  Everybody lies.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I try not to lie.  I try to tell the truth.  I try to learn the truth.  I don't care in the slightest about someone taking shots at me, calling me crazy or stupid.  I'm a well educated very smart person who happens to disagree with you about everything, and you better get used to it, because I'm not going anywhere.

                <h2>"Don't Explain Your Philosophy - Embody It" -Epictetus</h2>
                <p>
                    I love Philosophy.  I don't regret majoring in it.  It really interested me then, and still interests me now, even moreso.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Over the weekend I met a guy who was hosting a kickback.  He had an apartment overlooking the ocean in Santa Monica.  He had no TV.  The room was ocean-facing, you could say.  I asked if he read any books and he showed me "Ego is the Enemy" by Ryan Holiday.  I read some of the book right then and I listened to a couple of his lectures today and that's where I got the title of this post from.
                </p>
                <img class="picfloat" src="static/img/ryan.jpg" alt="ryanholiday">
                <p>
                    I've been so busy explaining my philosophy I've forgotten to embody it.  People might hear me philosophizing now and think, "Why should I listen to you?"  It's a very good point.  Maybe ten years ago people would be more open to my philosophy, when I had proof it was working.
                </p>
                <p>
                    But now, I'm 29 and I don't have a place overlooking the beach even though I want to.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I've lived on campus at UC Santa Cruz with an ocean view and it was incredible, however, I had a messy, smelly roommate who really killed the vibe.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I really respect someone who is able to live in such a way that they can have friends over for an awesome time.  I've hosted many successful parties but they were usually at my parents house, or in college, and not directly financed or controlled by myself.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm moving this month, so maybe I can create a nice vibe in my new place, but even now it's not too bad.  I have a nice balcony with a nice view of the mountains.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There's just something about the beach that makes me feel like a winner, though, when I'm there.  It feels like winning.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I want to be able to get what I want out of life.  And that is why I am fascinated with philosophy.  It can be a bit esoteric or eerie, but it can also be about practical ways to live the good life.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    I do not like being the guy who claims to have it all figured out.  It's arrogant and hard to live up to.  I would much rather be the guy who does less, says less. It would be easier for me if I just stuck to what I know I can prove.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For example, I know Math, Music, Chess, and Programming all to the point where it would be very difficult to challenge me in those subjects.  But there's something about Philosophy and Religion that is socially challenging to think you're an expert in.  Everyone has their own philosophy and religion, whether they know it or not.  Everyone has their attitudes about life and methods to get what they want, and everyone also has their opinion on God and the afterlife, even if it's ambivilent or agnostic.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There are things I know, where there's no going back.  I welcome the idea that I should shut up preaching and try to learn from people who are able to have what I want and don't have.  I want to be able to listen to someone like Ryan Holiday and learn from him.  He is smart and has a good grasp on Stoicism.  However, his interpretation of reality at face value, is just not something I can relate to.  He says he never watches the news, for example.  I never watch the news either.  But our reasons are different.  I don't know what he really thinks.  Maybe he knows it's total bullshit staged events half the time, and the other half is to validate the bullshit.  He claims it's just the news trying to get you to watch more news.  They let him talk at Google.  I doubt he's going to truly explain why the news is harmful.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I don't really want to go down the rabbit hole of explaining why Ryan Holiday doesn't actually have a clue what's going on.  It's honestly a depressing excercise.  And it makes me look stupid, because he's the one getting accolades and selling books.  He probably has a pretty girlfriend, a nice place to live, a nice car to drive, etc.  He's got things figured out that I don't have figured out yet.  However, he's allowed to get those things.  This system rewards his philosophy.  If he was directing people towards Jesus Christ or away from Covid Vaccines I doubt he'd make any money or get any praise from this society.
                </p>
                <p>
                    But maybe he's right and I'm wrong, right?  The proof is in the pudding.  He has proof, and I don't, if we're using Epictetus's rule of embodying our philosophy.  His philosophical embodiment is much more appealing than mine at the present moment and I get that and it's something I can't fix overnight.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I might read one of his books.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The point of this post is to shed all of my prior beliefs that can be shed, and to move forward only with what I know for sure.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Then I want to embody this new refined personal philosophy, and make my body more attractive.  I've already taken steps to improve my appearance, like hair cuts and clothes, but the physical body is the most important thing I have to work on.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So what do I know for sure?  What can I carry with me, and what can I leave behind?
                </p>
                <h4>What I Will Bring to my new self</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>My college degree in philosophy from UCSC</li>
                    <li>My coding bootcamp certificate from Coding Dojo</li>
                    <li>My one year of fulltime employment in insurance</li>
                    <li>My 2000+ Chess Rating and experience as a chess teacher</li>
                    <li>My Math Mastery on Khanacademy.org and my experience as a math tutor</li>
                    <li>My experience of Love and Heartbreak</li>
                    <li>My opinion that the News is Fake</li>
                    <li>My declaration that I will not take the Covid-19 Vaccine</li>
                    <li>My knowledge of the differences between Luciferianism and Christianity, and that Jesus is King.</li>
                    <li>My knowledge that conspiracy thoeries are a waste of time, once you know the news is fake and small things like not to take the vaccine, you can move on.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>If you want to take the vaccine, then go for it.  If you want to brush off the teachings of Christ and belive that he's a myth, or that there is no God, then go for that too.  I recommend learning about Jesus.  I caution against getting the vaccine, but I can't tell you what to do, or that I have it all figured out.  I have it figured out enough for me personally, to declare that I love Jesus and will not take the vaccine.  That doesn't mean I can live up to the standards Jesus set, and that doesn't mean I know what's in the vaccine.  It's just good enough for me to bring that with me into the next phase of my life.</p>

                <p>
                    I know I have a lot to learn.  I have a lot I want to accomplish that I haven't accomplished.  I want to get things back that I've lost.  There are people doing better than me.  I want more money.  I do.  I want more money so I can buy more things, and live better.  I have to admit what I want and set standards for failure so that I can achieve success.  Another thing I heard from Ryan Holiday today was that we all gradually get the life we are willing to tolerate.  He quoted Malcom X, saying, "That which you do not hate, you will eventually tolerate."  That's why Tolerance is the fakest virtue of all time and truly a complete vice, the worst of vices.  Nothing is so pathetic as luke-warm mediocrity.  I admit it, I've stumbled.  I've devolved into a life by tolerating failure instead of hating it.  If I hated certain things more, I wouldn't put up with it, and I would do something about it.  Life really does curve around what you aren't willing to accept.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For example in highschool I fell in love with a girl for the first time and I wanted her so badly, more than I've ever wanted anyone or anything.  She was my best friend and said no.  I hated it.  I hated everything about my situation as a failed suitor, so I become a madman working extremely hard on a 3 year plan that eventually landed me the hottest girl in the school, while getting my shot with the OG girl down the line.  I know that it was my intolerance that brought on my wildest success.  I refused to accept anything less then the hottest girl in the school, and I ended up dating the hottest girl in the school.  That's how life works.  And from this moment forward, I'm setting new goals and standards for myself.  Again, I don't want to be some arrogant prick.  I have a lot to learn and could use a lot of help, but dammit I do know some things, like how to become ranked in the top 1000 chess players in the world, and how to build this website.

                <h2>Luciferianism 101</h2>
                <p>

I believe a lot of people have never learned about what luciferianism (or satanism) really is. Please correct me if I'm wrong about any of this.
                </p>
                <p>
                
First, the backstory:
</p><p>
The biblical story of the Devil is that Lucifer was God's best angel. Lucifer was the most beautiful, and the most intelligent, etc. He was also the most proud. He thought he could do even better than God himself, his Creator, The Creator. So, He convinced 1/3 of all angels to join his cause in overthrowing God. There was a war in heaven. On God's side was Archangel Michael, who fought against Lucifer and his army in heaven. Lucifer transformed himself into a dragon during the fight and was still defeated by Archangel Michael.
</p>
<img class="picfloatnew" src="static/img/archangel.jpg" alt="michael">

<p>
Lucifer was expelled from heaven and fell down to Earth as a bolt of lightning, along with the rest of his fallen angels. 1/3 of Angels is 33%.  That is the occult significance of the number 33, and probably why the freemasons chose that as their final level.  God said from that moment that Lucifer would be known as Satan, or the Devil.
</p><p>
The Devil and his Fallen Angels now rule over the Earth, because they were kicked out of heaven.  There was also a great pit, and I'm honestly not sure how long the devil stayed down there.  But I'm pretty sure he and the rest of his army have dominion here.
</p><p>
Jesus, later on in the Bible, Lives on Earth and is tempted by the Devil who takes him to a mountain and shows him the 4 corners of the Earth and offers it all to him.  Jesus just quotes scripture to him and does not fall for his tricks, nor does he challenge the devil's claim that he owns the four corners of the Earth, implying that it is true.  
</p><p>

Jesus repeatedly says his kingdom is not of this world, during his time on Earth.
</p>
<img class="picfloatnew" src="static/img/eve.jpg" alt="eve">

<p>

In the story of Adam and Eve and the Garden of Eden, Satan is the snake in the garden that tells eve to eat from the tree of knowledge of good and evil that God forbid.
</p><p>

See, God put mankind into a garden of paradise, with the devil and 2 trees, 1 of eternal life, and 1 of the knowledge of good and evil.  He forbid them to eat from either tree.  The Devil as a snake convinces Eve to eat from the tree of knowledge of good and evil.  She takes a bite of the apple and then convinces Adam to do the same.  He doesn't take much convincing.  Then God finds out because they start acting differently and covering themselves up and hiding, whereas before they didn't even realize they were naked.  God then places a flaming sword (of judgment) in front of the tree of everlasting life, and curses the snake to have to slither around (it had legs) and the man to have to work and worry about the future, and the woman to have painful childbirth and to be dependant on her man.
</p><p>

God basically puts Man in a position where he has free will to choose.  God also gives man commands of what to do and what not to do.  (Also a conscience).  Lucifer argues that Man should not listen to God's restrictions.  Man should be like God.  
</p><p>

I don't know if the Snake from the Garden of Eden precedes Lucifer's war in heaven, but I think that probably makes to most sense.  Like God put the snake in the Garden, then it eventually became lucifer, and then became the Devil Again.  I don't know.  
</p><p>

The point is that some people, luciferians, believe in Lucifer's cause.  They view God as a dictator, and they view Lucifer as a revolutionary.  Lucifer, the light bringer, an angel of light, brought knowledge to Mankind at his own expense.  From this point of view, It was Lucifer who sacrificed himself for our salvation, not Jesus.  It was Lucifer who brought us the knowledge of Good and Evil, and it is God who restricts us and prevents us from becoming like him.  Reminds me of the story of Zeus, who was terrified of Human Beings' power when they had two heads and two bodies, so he split them into male and females so they would spend their time seeking their other halves instead of threatening his reign.  
</p><p>



Okay, so Lucifer gave man the knowledge of Good and Evil, and God cast him out of heaven for it.  But what is the knowledge of Good and Evil, truly?
</p><p>

Well, Nietzche wrote a book called "Beyond Good and Evil" with the most brilliant critique of Christianity of all time.  And I will explain it to you because it's necessary to understand how luciferians think about morality.  
</p>
<img class="picfloatsmall" src="static/img/nietzsche2.jpg" alt="goodevil">
<p>

Nietzsche classifies two types of morality.  Slave Morality, and Master Morality.
</p><p>

Master Morality, he argues, was there first.  When one cave man was bigger and stronger than another cave man, and bumped him over the head and stole his food, that stronger cave man saw himself as Good.   What he says goes.  He made his own value system.  He is good at feeding himself and fighting and the other cavemen is not.  The weak caveman is "bad" at feeding himself and protecting himself and getting what he wants.
</p><p>

Strong == Good,
</p><p>

Weak == Bad
</p><p>

That's how morality started.  It wasn't Good vs. Evil straight away in people's minds.  It was Good vs. Bad, the way someone is good or bad at basketball.  You wouldn't say a weak basketball player was "Evil".  Actually, you'd be more likely to call a good basketball player, like Michael Jordan or Kobe Bryant or Lebron James "Evil".  And that's where the Slave Morality comes in.
</p><p>

Nietzsche believes everything comes down to a will to power.  The strong cavemen has a will to power and he overpowers the weak and takes what he wants.  No problem.  The weaker cavemen, however, they too have a will to power to get what they want, but this will to power is repressed by the stronger men.  Therefore, this repressed will to power comes out in other ways.  For example, in Nietzsche's view, one day the weak caveman, after getting his dinner stolen again and his gf banged by the stronger caveman, the weak man said, "I'm not the bad man.  I'm good.  I'm morally superior.  I wouldn't steal from others and rape others if I was that strong.  You, the strong man, are EVIL, and it is I who is good."  There you have it.  The will to power of the slave eventually emerges and places itself on top of a new moral structure.  
</p><p>

The Strong believe they are good, and the weak are bad, and the weak believe the weak are good, and the strong are evil.
</p><p>

These two conflicting moralities are paramount in the conflict between Luciferianism and Christianity.  
</p><p>

Christianity worships and follows the teachings of Jesus Christ.  Jesus said things like, "The meek will inherent the Earth".  and "Blessed are the poor".  Jesus glorified weakness in a sense.  "Whoever humbles himself will be exalted".  He inverted the morality at the time and gave the weak a way to exercise their suppressed will to power.
</p><p>

Luciferianism, or Satanism, worships and follows the teachings of Lucifer.  Luciferians say things like, "Do as thou wilt".  Lucifer values strength as good, and weakness as bad.  Lucifer doesn't see the strong overpowering the weak as Evil, he sees it as Good, or at least, beyond Good and Evil.  Natural.  
</p><p>

God, on the other hand, gave his only son in an attempt to show people that humility is a virtue before God. 
</p><p>

Nietzsche, though, would argue that humility is not a virtue, but rather a disguised attempt to overpower the strong by inverting the morality.
</p><p>

---
</p><p>

So if God says homosexuality and transgenderism and abortion are wrong, Lucifer would argue that there is no such thing as "wrong".  There is only possibility, and the power to act.  So if you have the power to change genders, then do it!  Nothing is stopping you.  Luciferianism offers freedom from God's rules.  There are no rules in Luciferianism.  There are procedures within the church of Satan or the ranks of freemasonry, but at the highest level -- there are no limits to what you are allowed to do to another person, or animal.  Raping children is just natural to them if they want to do it and have the power to get away with it.  Sacrificing children is also nothing a true Luciferianism would have a problem with.
</p><p>

They hate Jesus.  Jesus ruins all the fun they think they're having.  The Luciferians are trying to expel their guilt and justify want they do that others would call "Evil".  Jesus makes them feel guilty about their evil deeds, so they absolutely hate Jesus and his teachings.  They just want to rule over the weak, guilt free.  They get off on violating innocence, because to them it's only ignorance.

</p><p>

So you see it's not some silly argument.  It's very sophisticated.  It's actually more sophisticated than Christianity.  But the truth doesn't have to be so hard to understand.  You are born with the truth, in the form of your conscience.  Your sense of Right and Wrong, or Good and Evil, is divine.  And you can try to get rid of it with Luciferian Philosophies, but it's still there, deep down.
</p><p>

So if the thought of Jesus rubs you the wrong way, that's why.  We all have wickedness in us, and wickedness hates righteousness.  Darkness abhors the light.  Comprehends it not.
</p><p>

But see the Luciferians argue that God is the Darkness, and Lucifer brings the light of the knowledge of Good and Evil.
</p><p>

So you have to decide what your light is, and what your darkness is.  
</p><p>

The funny thing is, Nietzsche's argument collapses into itself.  Because the luciferians believing they are enlightened, and others are in darkness without their esoteric knowledge... These Luciferians are really in the Darkness --- Absence of God's Light -- and they are using an inverted definition of light and dark to exercise their repressed will to power, in the same way they accuse the slaves of doing.  
</p><p>

God won in heaven.  He is Good.  The Bad, the losers, of the war in heaven, They are now inverting Heaven's morality and calling God Dark and themselves Light.  When the reality is, they are completely dark.
</p><p>
You can't even spell Good without God.  And Evil is live spelled backwards, or living backwards.
</p><p>

Class dismissed.

                <h2>Gain of Function</h2>
                <img src="static/img/denzel2.jpg" alt="training day" class="picfloatsmall">
                <p>
                    I always liked Ron Paul. One time he was asked by a reporter what his strategy was for tonight's debate.  "Tell the Truth" he said, as if it was a ridiculous question.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If anyone is telling the truth in Washington, it's him.  His son, Senator Rand Paul, is now in the news for grilling Dr. Fauci in an interview about whether or not the virus came from a lab.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It doesn't take a rocketscientist or even a 5th grader to be able to tell you that if a deadly virus appears nearby a virology lab, it probably came from the lab.
                </p>
                <p>
                    But let's talk about what these labs do.  They take benign animal viruses that cannot affect humans, and they do what's called "Gain of Function" research, where they supercharge the virus so that it can spread to humans.  The scientific reason for this, allegedly, is so they can study and learn from it. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Sounds like a pretty double-edged strategy to me.  On the one hand, you may gain some insight that somehow helps humanity.  On the other hand, you may create a virus worse than nature could have, and it may escape the lab, purposefully or by mistake.  Paying a lab to take an animal virus and design it to infect humans sounds a lot like a weapon of war to me.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Anyway, so Rand Paul is questioning Dr. Fauci about the obvious.  What does this mean?  Does this mean Rand Paul is an honest politician?  Maybe.  Another possibility is that this is a little show to quell the moderately intelligent conservative masses, who want to see Fauci getting grilled a little bit.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Maybe Rand Paul is legit.  I doubt it.  He could be controlled opposition, but I honestly don't know.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    All I know is, the idea of taking animal viruses and engineering them to infect humans is either a very stupid idea or a nefarious one.  I always lean towards nefarious.  I don't think it's believable that these people are that stupid.  I think the most obvious explanation of all of this is that some powerful group wanted to create a new virus to help further their agenda.
                </p>
                <p>
                    These double-edged scientific ideas are all stupid.  Studying viruses by making them better at killing humans is the most obvious example of a stupid/evil double edged idea.  Chemo and Vaccines are other examples of double-edged science.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The idea of Chemo is to attack your whole body when you have cancer and hope that the cancer is killed but you survive the attack.  That to me is a really stupid idea, but desperate times call for desperate measures.  Should be a last resort.  It's not something I would do under any circumstance.  I would rather die losing the fight to cancer than voluntarily giving myself radiation poisoning.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Then we have the vaccine argument.  The idea here is also double edged.  One the one hand you voluntarily take a shot of a virus and experience side-effects and some of the effects of the virus.  On the other hand, your body becomes educated on that virus and trains itself to kill it better next time.  The theory is that you can then fight off diseases preemptively by exposing yourself to a vaccine in a controlled environment instead of risking meeting the real virus head on in real life, unprepared.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This is also a very stupid/evil concept and should be a last resort, just like chemotherapy.  I would rank them 1) Gain of Function Research 2) Chemotherapy 3)Vaccines in order of stupidity.  If there truly is an unstoppable virus, and a vaccine is the only way to go, then it makes some sense.  But the basic premise is still stupid.  If I choose not to take the Covid Vaccine, I may never run into the real Covid Virus and be perfectly fine.  Why would I want to take on the risk of a Vaccine when I may avoid the virus altogether?  You want me to voluntarily stand in line for an injection of a virus so I'll be better at fighting off something I may never catch in the first place?  Moronic.  Completely idiotic.  We've all been trained to think vaccines are so smart but the basic premise is laughable to even a child.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Medicine doesn't have to be double edged.  When you drink water, you don't lose IQ points (unless there's flouride).  Water is just good for you.  There's no need for anything medicinal to be so double-edged.  It's madness.  I think focusing on making things better, in a way that never makes anything worse, is the obvious course of action.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Meanwhile you have people choking down Anti-Depressants thinking they have to put up with the side effects to be happy.  How about you go for a walk instead?  There's no negative side effects from taking a stroll.  People are completely insane.  There's no logic to taking an animal virus and making it able to infect humans unless your goal is to kill humans.  There's no logic to attacking a cancer patient with radiation unless you want to make that person even more sick.  There's no logic to injecting a healthy person with a virus unless you want to infect healthy people.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I hear people complain about the vaccine's side effects.  Meanwhile I'm just sitting here, perfectly fine without one.  It doesn't even occur to the average person that they could have chosen to simply not inject themselves with poison, and just take their chances with nature and life.

<p>

As I contemplated on it, I realized that it was an opportunity to summarize much of what
was previously addressed in a more condensed manner (as much as we can condense that
which, through words, needs so many of them to even attempt at a glimpse of
realization). It is fitting to do such a review as I still am in the mournful wake of Bu's
passing (to better understand Bu's importance and significance, please refer to the
contemplations named “Walk of Life”, “I lob tchiken” and “Droopy eared Angel”).

<audio controls src="static/audio/Bullet.mp3"></audio>
<p>


«The world is a vampire, set to drain» - this is the statement that begins the song “Bullet
with butterfly wings” from the band Smashing Pumpkins. Not that I am a fan, particularly,
but this is one of those lyrics that could serve as an example for a transmuted spell, that
was cast on the communication channels of pop culture. Certainly, the idea behind it was
the promotion of the depression, demoralization and internal strife that so characterized
Emo culture. This culture was but one among many others that served as a hook to
capture any post-children (or adolescents, in other words) that were going through the
conflict stemming from the realization that what was conveyed and offered to them in
childhood had nothing to do with adult life. To capture them, first they were sold fantasies
as children, then thrown head on against reality's wall, only to then offer identification
frameworks, examples, settings, entire cultures. This would not only prevent the individual
from using that conflict of facing reality to contemplate and perhaps connect to an
ineffable source, a Truth only realized but never touched, beyond the fog of the world, but
also to be packaged, catalogued and stored into an array of acceptable identification. By
acceptable, one must understand that it is meant an identification that feeds the world
itself. So, going back to the lyrics I mentioned, the intent behind «The world is a vampire,
set to drain» was not a warning against the obvious vampire of the world, but a promotion
of helplessness in the face of it and a preparation to become its feeder by becoming
paladin of the wrong master and going against the wrong enemy. And what is the wrong
master? Anything that is not Life and Love. And what is the wrong enemy? Anything that
would remove the individual from that vampirized state. Nevertheless, despite this, those
lyrics do state a fact that can be transmuted to a higher truer sense and, therefore, be
read as a warning that is moral in nature. It is, ultimately, how we read them, what we
internally make of the spells given to us, that constitute our deeper Moral choices.
</p>
<p>


As was stated in the contemplation “System's Recruitment”, that Maxwell wrote about in
his blog post, the idea of the world is to recruit the Living, that is, to convince the Living to
generate food for the world of fog or the vampire. How is this done at a deeper level?
Sure, we all can understand that someone who starts off pure-hearted can then be
tempted into accepting gradual changes that will deviate them from that purity and even
turn them into evil enforcers. Yet, at a deeper level, how is that done? What happens
beneath the visible surface of cause and effect?
</p>
<p>



I will use two metaphors to try to describe it and none are particularly new, but they do
not need to be, however, they complement each other.
</p>
<p>


One is that the vampire feeds not directly from the Life of the Living (as it cannot touch it
or it will kill it, like the sunlight of vampire myths) but from the transformation, or predigestion if you like, of that Life into a tumour form, a decaying and death-aligned mass.
So the Living is convinced, by strife and shock, to willingly use some of their Life to
generate a dead mass that can be consumed by the vampire (or bacteria and fungi, as is
used in that contemplation). By doing so, the world can then feed a whole food chain of
cult priests, not only at the manifest human level, but also mental levels (for more on this,
refer to the contemplation named “Cult of Sin”). Basically, a parasitical lifeform that
convinces the all-important host to enact behaviour that feed it and protect it – very
prevalent in nature. In fact, parasitism is nature's favourite lifestyle because it is the most
successful in it. This can only be explained if nature's mind (so to speak) is already also
taken over by a parasitical identification, or, otherwise, if nature itself is part of the original
parasite. That is a debate that is quite fruitful to have, in terms of circumstance
perception. If one is so inclined to it, I would suggest reading the Acts of Pilate, a part of
the Gospel of Nicodemus, apocrypha, whose Part II serves as a most dramatic and
interesting depiction of the Christian . <a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150705090754/http://folk.uio.no/lukeb/books/apocrypha/
Gospel_of_Nicodemus.pdf">“Harrowing of Hell”</a>
</p>
<p>


Another metaphor is that of the mirror or mirrors; and this metaphor is more helpful to
understand the importance and significance of our internal alignment. If we come to
realize and accept that we have a Life or a treasure that the parasites need us to use in a
certain way for their survival and proliferation, then we need to understand how this
process works and also, most importantly, how the parasites come to be in the first place.
Imagine that each of us have a mirror that is also simultaneously a window that looks out
onto the world and whose window throws onto the world our internal state of affairs. The
world itself is a mirror too, so it reflects the type of image cast by our window back at us.
Then, our individual mirror potentially reflects that same image. If the two mirrors are
aligned and are reflecting that image, it will create an “infinity mirror” effect, which is
basically a reflection that is endlessly replicated to infinity, even though it becomes smaller
and less defined the farther it is from the original image.
<img class="picfloat" src="static/img/mirror.jpg" alt="mirror">
</p><p>
Therefore, if we can be convinced to project onto the mirror of the world a parasite or
food for it, it will replicate in this way, as the individual mirror and the world mirror will
reflect each other and our cast image. This is why it is important to first look internally, to
observe everything around us as a manifest image of something within, so that we can
purify the image we project, at least, or even be able to one day not project at all and
leave the shadow world, at best (for more on this, please refer to the contemplation
“Shadow Play”).
</p>
<p>
These two metaphors were discussed in both “Metaphors of Tumours” and “Mirror”
contemplations.
</p><p>
In summary, «the world is a vampire, set to drain» yes, but we were the ones who
projected it and keep projecting it as it is. There is an interlinked code in Christianity (but
not in the bible) that is very useful in that regard: the seven deadly sins. These are
interlinked because the “sins” feed each other too and they change our inner color (refer
to the contemplation named “Sin and Forgiveness”). However, if one can become alert to
the influence these have within us, it will be already like opening a curtain and letting the
sunlight hit the vampire of the world, because the shadow reflected on that infinity mirror
effect and the production of those tumours it feeds on is halted.

                    Wow.  I really like the mirror analogy. And the tumours.  Any time cancer analogies are brought up I think of <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/user/lukasig">Jonathan Adampants</a> "The Healing Begins Now" Audio series where he talks about the cancer-consciousness. Another thing I like about this guest post is that he talks about looking inward, and fixing what's in here, in order to fix what's out there.  Realizing that the hell around us is a reflection of our internal state is very wise indeed.  All my favorite thinkers have that in common.  Jesus said,

                    Gnarles Barkley has a song called Crazy.  Almost everybody has heard it.  But there is a difference between hearing it, and living it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the first verse he is reflecting on a time he went crazy.  He says "I was out of touch, but it wasn't because I didn't know enough.  I just knew too much".
                </p>
                <p>
                    I just bought a new hoody, and I love the strings that come down around the hood, because they remind me on my sanity.
                </p>
                <p>

                    When you truly go crazy, and end up in a psyche ward, they take the string from your hoodie so you can't hang yourself.  I never got mine back and the lack of a string served as a reminder for me of that situation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now I'm able to buy a new hoodie with new strings and think about how they'll never take them away from me again.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I like what Gnarles Barkley says about going crazy because it's true.
                </p>
                <p>
                    People thought I was crazy because I was going by the name of Elam and taking very drastic measures to change the world.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I called myself Elam, because I was in a state of rebellion.  I realized that the enemy of the state was man.  This evil society is deprived of real men.  It's been so stamped out of us we don't even know what a real man is anymore.  
                </p>

                    Here is a video of a girl explaining the crisis of men today.  Testosterone and sperm counts are pathetic.  This girl is smart and I would say she has a clue, but any measurement of society without taking into account the grand conspiracy and false reality is incomplete, so I will assist her.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It's not an accident that men are dwindiling in their masculinity.  There's not even such a thing as a man anymore, if you want to be policitaclly correct.  It's said it is a spectrum of gender, and men can just switch if they feel like it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I myself grew up as a rather masculine boy, comparitively speaking.  I played some quarterback and won a fist fight or two.  I also dated feminine girls and whatnot.  My perspective is that if I am struggling with my own masculinity, the rest of the world is completely fucked.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I couldn't have asked for an easier ride to success as a male.  So if my path is difficult, god only knows what horrors haunt the men around me.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Online pornography is contributing to the destruction of men.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    I can't imagine how difficult it must be for some guys, given how difficult it is for me, and I have real experience with real girls to compare it to.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Shortly before going "Gnarles Barkley Crazy" I started getting into some weird porn that was actively encouraging my feminitity and the destruction of my masculinity.  I think you catch my drift.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I was terrified at how much it turned me on and I feared I would lose my masculinity forever, so I rebelled.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Tonight, I was reading Jordan Peterson's book 12 Rules for Life and he talks about the person's need to pick an ideal that is superior to oneself and reach for it even if they can't grab it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I chose to aspire to be "The Alpha Male" because it was the opposite of what I had been devolving into due to the porn and other factors.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Alpha Male spelled in reverse is Elam Ahpla.  The capitilization really hides it.  And I love the name Elam.  I've been baptized by the name of Elam.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Anyway, in my quest to reach my new ideal of the alpha male, I shut down most of my electronics and quit all my vices.  I became new.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Quitting smoking cigarettes and weed, and watching porn, and playing video games caused a massive shock to my system, and ultimately resulted in some cannibis-withdrawal psychosis, so I did go "out of touch" but I never lost sight of the purpose of my rebellion.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    Getting locked up as a crazy person was better than continuing to degrade myself day by day, erasing what little masculinity I had left, and getting off on it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I didn't care what my fate was, as long as it was in the other direction as to what I was doing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now I've learned that I went too far, and quiting all those things at once was asking for trouble, but I'm ready to try again.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I've successfully quit marijuana and tobacco.  I haven't had them since new year's eve, and before that for several more months.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I've been using porn though, and gaming, and I'm not ready to give up gaming, but I think I have to seriously reduce my porn usage, if not altogether wipe it out.  Because there's no substitute for gaming, in videogames I can have a fight to the death without the risk of dying.  The substitute for porn is sex, which is actually better.  Call of Duty in real life is war, which is not ideal.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This system is evil that we live under.  The last thing it wants is an alpha male.  So that is what I wish to become.  Not only do I want to return to my former form, when I was at my most masculine, maybe senior year of high school, but I want to surpass that form, and truly represent everything this system is trying so desperately to destroy.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    I use the name of Max to operate legally in this life.  But I have declared myself an LLP, or a limited liability person.  And my true identity, my spiritual self-given identity is Elam.  And whatever happens to Max that is bad, does not bring Elam down with it.  Elam is my spiritual self.  My ideal that I'm chasing.  My ideal within.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    I have learned from my experience trying to radically change my life, and make no mistake, I will try again, and I will succeed.

                <p>
                    I first saw this video of a man passing the bar on my linkedIn Newsfeed on mute.  I liked it so much that I decided to repost it but I never actually listened to it until today.  The mother yells, "Hallelujah, thank you Jesus!" and I think that's really cool giving credit to God.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Sometimes I go on bibledice, like I did just now, and I get the perfect quote.  I just got:
                </p>
                <p class="verse">
                    "Colossians 3:17

                    And whatsoever ye do in word or deed, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God and the Father by him."
                </p>
                <p>
                    Tell me that doesn't apply to what I was just talking about.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Sometimes I'll go on bible dice and ask a specific question before I hit the button.  I asked, "Am I doing good with this website?  Am I doing what you want me to do?"
                </p>
                <p>Here's what I got immediately:</p>
                <div class="verse">
                    <p>
                        Ecclesiastes 1
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Vanity of vanities, says the Preacher
                    </p>
                    <p>Vanity of vanities! All is vanity.</p>
                </div>
                <p>
                    I was kind of shocked by the answer I got.  I think people are typically afraid to ask God questions because of what he might say, but I'll just speak for myself.  I'm often shy about asking for anything because I think I don't deserve it or that I'm not doing everything in my power to get it myself.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Any question I can formulate for God I can usually formulate an answer that comes to me immediately of what he might say, however, in this method I usually do not like the answers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Anyway, back on topic, I kept clicking for more verses for further clarification on if God thought my website was pure vanity.  I proceeded to get the very next verse in the same passage about vanity and then basically like 7 verses in a row about the exact same answer to my question.

                    The full verse is so poetic I'm going to share it below.  I don't want this whole blog to be a bible verse, but I think it's worth studying the bible.  It's just too important to brush off in my opinion.

                        The Vanity of Wisdom
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        12 I the Preacher have been king over Israel in Jerusalem. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        13 And I applied my heart[f] to seek and to search out by wisdom all that is done under heaven. It is an unhappy business that God has given to the children of man to be busy with.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        14 I have seen everything that is done under the sun, and behold, all is vanity[g] and a striving after wind.[h]
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        15 What is crooked cannot be made straight,
                        and what is lacking cannot be counted.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        16 I said in my heart, “I have acquired great wisdom, surpassing all who were over Jerusalem before me, and my heart has had great experience of wisdom and knowledge."
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        17 And I applied my heart to know wisdom and to know madness and folly. I perceived that this also is but a striving after wind.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        18 For in much wisdom is much vexation,
                        and he who increases knowledge increases sorrow.
                    </p>

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        "He who increases in knowledge increases sorrow".  Ignorance is bliss.

                        I'm not really a coder/philosopher guy.  I'm a jock, pretending to be smart.  I'm an imposter.  I'm a chicken.  I had a condition develop in college that caused me severe social anxiety so I tried to see how much damage I could do long-distance.  I become a pro in gaming, chess, coding, music, anything I could do from afar, and my in-person skills like being an amazing athlete with incredible social skills and popularity -- those skills all deteriorated.  
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I've sense balanced out a tiny bit.  My social anxiety is gone but the damage was done.  I'm basically an introvert now, but it doesn't take long to recognize when your with me that my true element is playing beer bong all night and hitting on girls or throwing a football.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Anyway, I can tell you that the knowledge I gained in my quest to stay away from people but still try to be competitive -- In that quest I gathered so much knowledge that caused sorrow.  When you see what the white blood cell sees, you realize that the body is in the process of dying.  This society is sick, and the more you know the more you realize that, and not only is it sick, but the other blood cells are toxic and contributing to the sickness, and it's impossible to convince them of that. See my post below called <a href="#wbc">White Blood Cells</a>
                        for more on that actual process.  I use real academic sources!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Knowledge is sorrow.

                    <p>
                        Anyway, I heard an excellent presentation today the QOC (quatum of conscience) recommended.  I'll include it here:

                    <p>
                        This video is similar to a blog post I already made about the narrow gate but he makes some astronomically brilliant parallels between faith in Jesus and faith in the Vaccine.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        See, the belief or teaching that all you have to do to get into heaven is just believe in Jesus as if he already did all the work for you is a little bit too convenient to be truly a narrow gate.  Lots of people would take that deal.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Who do you think gets into heaven?  Someone who decides at the last second to believe in Jesus before he dies without ever reading the bible, or someone like me who reads it periodically and changes his mind back and forth and contemplates it deeply and experiments with it?  
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        See blind faith is not enough.  Even if you read it every day, if you never explore your own doubts then in my opinion your faith is hollow.  It is only when you've explored both faith and doubt to the fullest that you can truly begin to believe.

                    <h3>Evil Preacher</h3>
                    <p>
                        I was once in the house of a Christian woman and I asked after church if she had any questions.  She dropped the dish she was carrying and was so startled by the notion that she should be allowed to explore her doubt that I could see in her she had been programmed by that church to just accept whatever they say is true.  That church was also evil because I asked the preacher a simple question in front of everyone and he couldn't give me a good answer, and I had countless people come up to me after and share their astonishment at my good question.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I said, "How do I believe in God when things are going well and I have a lot of money?  It's easier for me to believe in God when I am poor or things are not going well, but if I'm living large, how can I keep my faith in God when I don't need him?"
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Something like that.  I was prodding at the idea that God is easy to believe in for the Weak, who need it to feel okay about their bad situation.  But when you're living super well, there is less need to tell stories or believe in fairy tales.  It's a pattern I had noticed in my own life, and I've read Nietzche and understand and respect the best counterarguments of Christianity.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        He gave me some bullshit verse in Matthew about tending the Lillies. Like, don't worry about money, God will clothe you like he does the flowers.  That doesn't answer my question, it just proves my point.  I'm not worried about God not taking care of me when I'm poor, I was worrying about leaving God behind when I'm rich, and the "expert" in the room couldn't direct me to a verse I hadn't already read in the most blatantly obvious part of the bible.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Here's how I know they were evil.  It was subtle, but clear as day.  One of the "brothers" of the church was ill or maybe his wife was or something bad.  Anyway we had a group prayer for him.  Okay, no problem, I'll do it.  But then, get this!  After that they had a seperate special "Brothers Only" prayer.  Where some people with higher spiritual status got up onto the stage and only they were allowed to pray for that same thing. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        They wanted us all to watch in admiration at like 9 guys huddled up doing a prayer where we aren't allowed to participate because we are not worthy or would screw it up.  Disgusting.  To have a special prayer is fine but to make us all watch?  I walked out and never went back.  Those poor souls in the audience don't realize what sort of game the preacher was playing.  They didn't care about the missing brother's problems.  He might have been on vacation getting his dick sucked.  They only cared about creating an exclusive class and power structure within their church so they could humilate and demean their audience and we would all look up to them as superior.   It truly is the opposite of what Christ would do.  Christ would bend down and tie your shoelace, and pay attention to the lowest of the low, and he would never dream of excluding you from anything as "less than" him.  He would welcome you as an equal, and he came to be a servent to, rather than to be worshipped.  These priests I encountered were frauds and whipped the whole thing upside down right in front of everybody too fast for them to notice.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Anyway, God told me I'm vain. He told me, "This website you're making, it won't change anyone's mind.  It won't glorify me, It's just vanity."  And it is.  It's mostly vanity.  I made a music app and I like it and I listen to it and I don't care if no one else does.  It's my damn iPod.  I have all my music on my web app and it serves as my iPod.  I like writing this blog and I don't care if I'm the only one reading it.  I love myself.  I don't want to be vain.  I need to work on my ego and my vanity.  I want to be better, but boy was God right with Bibledice.  I do think it's good to code.  I do not think I'm supposed to let my skills go to waste, but I definitely have to keep an eye on my vanity.

                <p>
                    It's not the White Blood Cell's job to convince the Red Blood Cells that there is an infection.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The White Blood Cell is supposed to take the evidence to other White Blood Cells and attack the infection together.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It's not that the white blood cells are better or smarter than the red blood cells, it's that they have a different purpose.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A red blood cell does its job carrying oxygen to the organs and tissues.  It is vital to the body's survival.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So too is the white blood cell.  The WBC scans for signs of danger.  The WBC shapeshifts to move more quickly before erradicating it's target.
                </p>
                <img src="static/img/wbc.jpg" alt="cells" class="picfloatsmall">
                <p>
                    White blood cells are less common than red blood cells.
                </p>
                <p>
                    White blood cells recognize when the body is under attack before red blood cells do because it is the job of the wbc to be alert.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If a white blood cell wasn't confident enough in what he saw, and asked around with red blood cells, or tried to convince them of the infection, nothing would get done and the body would die.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It is the duty of the white blood cell to ignore the red blood cells and commune with other wbcs and form a strategy of how to engulf or kill the infection in order to save the body.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    "Bacterial infection causes red blood cells to rupture, releasing the oxygen-transporting molecule haemoglobin. As this oxidizes, it releases free haeme, which can trigger programmed cell death." <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/467637a">source</a>
                </p>
                <p>
                    In other words, when there is an infection, the red blood cells are damaged and actually become harmful.  They drop the oxygen they were carrying and it becomes toxic.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So not only are the red blood cells oblivious to the attack, but they contribute to it.  When under attack, the white blood cell has to stop the infection from turning the red blood cells into toxic death traps.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I think I am a white blood cell.  Do you?  If you don't think the body of government/ earth/ humanity is sick, then you're probably not a wbc.  If you don't appreciate the metaphor, then you're probably not a wbc.  WBC's study disease.  Then when one comes along, they bring evidence to their wbc peers and one of them says, "I've studied that, here's how to kill it!" Then they all go save the body.

                <p>
                    In times of Disease, the white blood cells are super important and need to act before the red blood cells become toxic and kill the body.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    In times of Health, the red blood cells are super important because they need to move oxygen around the body so it functions properly when it's healthy.  The WBC's have a minor role at that time just casually looking for danger and raising the alarm over small threats.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm raising the biggest alarm I can. This entire website is like a white blood cell on a bullhorn saying "We are under attack!  White Blood Cells, Assemble!"
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the metaphor I'm using, the red blood cell could be like a surgeon, performing life saving procedures. It's not the surgeons job to watch illuminati videos on youtube.  He's supposed to concentrate on his craft.  He is a Red Blood Cell.  It's nothing to be ashamed of.  It's necessary.  It's more necessary than White Blood Cells, and that's why there are more of them.
                </p>
                <p>
                    White blood cells would be like the truthers.  They spend their time studying dystopias and tyrannies in history and fiction like 1984 and Brave New World.  They major in philosophy.  Then they raise the alarm when Covid Vaccine Passports remind them of papers in Nazi Germany.  "Hey, I've seen this before!" They say. Or, "I don't like where this is going..."  My job is not to be a brain surgeon.  It's to gather all the evidence I have gleaned of the infection (tyranny) as a white blood cell (truther), and to advertise the problem so other white blood cells (truthers) can join up and fight the infection (tyranny).

                <h4>Rejection Letters</h4>
                <p>
                    When I graduated from Coding Dojo I started applying for jobs as a web developer and game designer.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I would hear nothing back, or when I did hear something back, it was a rejection letter.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I was spending so much of my time trying to be accepted by them, I was barely getting any work done.  Then something occured to me.
                </p>
                <p>
                    What if I switched the script on these companies?  What if instead of receiving rejection letters I wrote them one instead?
                </p>
                <p>
                    "Dear Google", I wrote, "Thank you for your interest in me and your offer of a position in your company.  However, at this time, I'm focused on my personal projects like making a 3D video game.  Sincerely, Maxwell Lawrence Jann."
                </p>
                <p>
                    This put me in a mindset of abundance rather than lack.  In order to write that letter I had to enter the mindset of being valuable.  I had to justify the letter and come up with reasons why I was turning them down.  With this new mindset, my productivity soared, and wouldn't you know, Google called me for an interview.  I never even applied.  All I did was write them a rejection letter and not send it anywhere.  I flipped the script on Reality.  Instead of not getting accepted anywhere, I had Google pitching me.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Then Amazon came knocking as well.  I also didn't apply to them.  I wasn't applying anywhere, I was just working.  Suddenly I had 2 dream interviews set up.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I ended up blowing all my interviews.  I was addicted to marijuana and video games and just blew it.  The night before my Amazon interview I was up all night smoking and in the morning I was basically too sick to do it, but it made no sense anyway because I wasn't prepared.
                </p>
                <h4>Girlfriend wanted vs. Girls vying for my attention</h4>
                <p>
                    When I went to Santa Cruz for the second time, in my senior year, I was intent on getting a girlfriend.  It was my goal.  To pass my classes and get a girlfriend.  It wasn't really working out trying to get a girlfriend, then suddenly I came across this video online. It was a hypnosis video called "Pretty girls are vying for my attention" and it just said that over and over.  It was welcome to me because I was so tired of trying to get a girlfriend I liked the idea of them trying to get me for a change.  The next day, I met my girlfriend.  I just walked right up to her table and sat down and had lunch with her and got her number and asked her out.  I was of the mindset that she wanted that to happen, so it did.  When my mindset was that I want it, it wouldn't work, but the instant I flipped the script on Reality, I had a beautiful college girlfriend named Ashley.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I can't find the video but it may have been pornagraphic. I think it was on a pornagraphic website but somehow not explict.  Anyway, it was hypnosis and it totally worked and I ended up graduating that year with that girlfriend and she was asking me to be her boyfriend and sleeping with me before I knew what happened. I said no because I already had a date with my crush I suddenly had the confidence to ask out.  It was very bizarre how fast everything changed after my perspective did.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Those are the 2 that stick out to me.  More recently I would say that I switched my mindset at work from "This is broken" to "I'm going to fix it and it's going to be awesome" and that worked out nicely with a raise, but it's not quite as awesome as a girlfriend or a google interview.

                <p>
                    I guess what I've decided is that I'm going to build an awesome website and create worthwhile content to the best of my ability and I'm going to create an online ecosystem where people can experience my contribution to the world.  My gift to people.

                <h2>Godzilla vs. Kong</h2>
                <h3>04/08/2021</h3>

                <p>
                    Yes, I'm writing a paper on the new movie Godzilla vs. Kong.  This essay is not for the uninitiated.  I'm not going to hamstring myself by walking you through how I got here.   I'm going to be writing about the bleeding edge of my thoughts.  I think that Godzilla vs. Kong contained many hidden messages and profound meaning.  I think you had the usual Hollywood tricks, but also some truth drops as well as an esoteric theme.
                </p>
                <p>Godzilla represents God.  King Kong represents Humanity.  Mechagodzilla represents technology.</p>
                <p>King kong doesn't bow down to anyone, not even Godzilla.  This pisses Godzilla off.  Godzilla pins King Kong, and instead of finishing him off with his atomic breath, he just roars in his face, and Kong finally submits with a roar of his own acknowledging, "Ya, you win".  Godzilla has proven his point and walks away.</p>
                <p>In an earlier scene, Godzilla attacks the corporation Apex because they are making Mechagodzilla and trying to replace him.  God doesnt like technology trying to play God.  The theme of this movie is that once man submits to God, he and God can work together to overcome technology.  Technology is the real enemy.  The little deaf girl in the film who communicates with Kong even tells him, "Godzilla is not your enemy.  That (Mechagodzilla) is your enemy."  So King Kong, who represents us and our hubris, switches from losing an impossible battle with God, to teaming up with God against technology.</p>
                <p>The hollywood tricks are having things like wacky conspiracy theorists and podcasts and kind of poking fun at the whole truth movement.  They even mention fluoride in the tap water.  Hollywood also drops a 33 several times in the film, but none more significant than in the elevator.   In the beginning of the movie, you have a black podcaster conspiracy theorist trying to expose his own company, apex.  He hacks into the computer and sees something secret on "Sublevel 33" in the manifest.  The number 33 is a reference to freemasonry and the 33rd degree being the highest degree.</p>
                <p>Later in the elevator, the black guy and millie bobby brown and her sidekick are traveling to the sublevel 33 and the sidekick asks, "How deep does it go?"  and the black guy replies, "Hell.  It goes all the way to Hell".  This is one of the most crucial parts of the movie to understand.  Since the 33rd sublevel is a reference to freemasonry, the sidekick is really asking "What happens if you keep progressing after reaching the 33rd rank?"  And then Hollywood is saying back, "You can keep going deeper and deeper into the secret societies until it takes you all the way to hell."  Like the Devil, is an infinity degree mason.  </p>
                <p>See, Lucifer thought he could outdo God.  That's the whole idea of this movie.  Godzilla is God which means he rules over Kings, like King Kong.  God is King of Kings.  But Lucifer thinks he can use technology to overpower God.  Lucifer goes to war with God.  Lucifer loses and is cast out to Earth with his angels.  That's where we are.  Lucifer is still trying to outdo God by playing God himself in a competitive way.  </p>
                <p>
                    So eventually, like in the final scene of the movie, technology and God will go to war again, and humanity will be watching.  And we should side with God and defeat technology.  Instead of rebelling against God, like Humanity is currently doing, we should be rebelling against technology instead and honouring God.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Luciferian mindset would be for Kong to side with Mechagodzilla and watch Godzilla die.  The Irony of that is that Mechagodzilla would probalby kill King Kong after he's done with Godzilla.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    Godzilla is the only thing capable of overpowering King Kong without killing him.  Like, King Kong has to chose in the final scene between two masters.  Technology or God.  Only God will spare him as his master.  Technology will destroy him.  The little deaf girl explains this to him and she would represent wisdom or compassion in this movie.  So Kong sides with Godzilla and then has a truce with him at the end, an understanding that they can work together, and that Godzilla could kill him if he really wanted to, and that's okay,  
                </p>
                <p>
                    Better to deal with the devil you know, then the one you don't.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You cannot serve two masters,  God and Technology.  Either you will hate one or despise the other,  In the bible the two masters are God and Money.  But I think Technology is becoming more important than money. 

                </p>
                <p>
                    Godzilla even has God in his name.  And King Kong is a monkey, and we have most in common with monkies.  I think it's a Titan Metaphor for the relationship between God, Man, and Technology.  I think the deeper you go into freemasonry, the closer you get to hell.  Hell is for people who chose Technology over God.  Hell is the place for The Devil who was Lucifer and all the fallen Angels who thought they could do better than God.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    Trying to replace God is the ultimate act of disrespect toward your creator.  I always operate under the assumption that I know very little compared to God.  I see more wisdom in a tree than I do in most people.  I see the branches sprawling in different directions to get sunlight, and the root structure making the most of its surroundings.  I view nature as supremely intelligent.  Man can try to beat it with technology, but that's a luciferian pursuit.  I think there is a place for technology, but that it's important to respect God and Nature while you're building it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Amen.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Again, if you think you don't need God to get to Heaven.  If you think you can create your own heaven or be your own God that is what Lucifer thought too.  If you think you don't need the keys to Hades that Jesus has to overcome death, if you think you can build your own keys and become immortal yourself with technology then you are antichrist and luciferian.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Also, notice how the human who builds the technology to overthrow God(zilla) ends up getting killed by his own technology.  So, the message God is sending is that if you try to overthrow him with technology it will be your own demise.  That path is death.  Surrendering to God is the only path to life, for King Kong, or humanity.
                </p>
                <p>Thanks!</p>

                    <p>I took another crack at making a <a href="meme.html">meme creator app</a> .  It's surprisingly difficult to make the picture the user enters into a meme where the top and bottom text appear over the picture.  Text, pic, Text is easy but having the three jumbled together is very hard to work with.  My idea was to use an invisable image of the same image in between the text.  That way I can set the background to the whole div and have my text inside that background with the proper space in between.  It works but I have to set background image to cover instead of contain.  Problem with "cover" is that it fills up the whole div even if part of it is off screen.  Contain will shrink it down so it fits but I need it to cover the whole div so the text is agains the picture instead of over it or below it.</p>

                    I like making DJ Aliens so much I want to make more single page web applications.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I've always liked messing around with Object Oriented Programming.  I've made DBZ games in the past
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now I'm making a <a href="cards.html">pokemon card game</a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Eventually I would want to make up my own card game with my own rules and strategy
                </p>
                <p>
                    It would be fun to make a game with AI that I enjoy playing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The latest pokemon game was too easy, so I want something like that but more challenging.

                    This video from Matt discusses Travelling to Hawaii during Covid and being forced to quarantine in a hotel room even when you're not sick.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    My friend Matt, who in my last video I compared to the Fields Medal Winner in Good Will Hunting, recently travelled to Hawaii and had to deal with quarantining as well.  Matt from Quantum of Conscience also had a friend locked down due to a paperwork error.  This video is pure gold so I'm going to introduce a new gold color scheme for special posts like this moving forward.

                    And let me just say, What's the difference between the Taliban forcing women to cover their faces, and my local Jersey Mike's doing the same thing for me to get my sandwich?

                    In order for me to go out into public and get a sandwich, I have to wear a mask.  If I forget my mask, I will be unable to purchase my food.  So do you see the connection to the Taliban situation now?  You might think, well God isn't real so those Taliban guys are forcing dumb rules for a nonexistant God, whereas in the US we are free but coronavirus is real so we have to take precautions.  No.  The situations are parallel and the same.  The fact is both you in america today and a girl in the taliban of 10 years ago both have to put on a face covering to go out in public. Period.

                    What's the point of a bill of rights when the Government is in a perpetual state of emergency?  How can people actually think they have any rights or civil liberties when they are circumvented at the drop of a hat by our Governor Gruesome.  Gavin Newsome - G. Newsome - Gruesome I'll call him.  Gaverner Gruesome can just order my movie theater to be closed and my job to fire me because of an invisible threat, so where are my rights?  It's madness.

                <img src="static/img/liarliar.jpg" alt="liar" class="picfloatsmall">
                <p>
                    In my last post in the video I talk about how everyone lies in the world and how it would be better if we told the truth.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Then I mentioned Liar Liar and how I wanted to watch it again to see if telling the truth worked out for him in the end.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I just rewatched it on the <a href="https://www4.f2movies.to/watch-movie/liar-liar-17854.2508583">free streaming site</a> I mentioned and I laughed my ass off.  He's a phenomenal actor and comedian.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    Then I started watching a video of his recent philosophy and he talks about the meaning of life as loving yourself and being visible and true to others. His philosophy ties into my own in the previous post.
                </p>
                <h4>Rejection Letters</h4>
                <p>
                    Jim's philosophy is dope.  He talks about how he used visualization of director's interest even when he had nothing.  After coding bootcamp, I was getting rejection letters from job applications and I was getting tired of the dynamic so I switched it.  I decided to write a rejection letter to Google.   I wrote out by hand a real document turning down a google job saying that I appreciate their offer but I'd like to focus on my own company, website, and video games I was making.  After writing the rejection letter to Google, I just started focusing on my work instead of applying for jobs and then Amazon and Google recruiters reached out to me and gave me multiple interviews.  I also had a visualization experience in College where I watched a hypnotic video saying over and over that "pretty girls are vying for my attention" because I was tired of trying to find a girlfriend.  I met my girlfriend for that year the next day in the dining hall.  Something about changing your mentality produces results so fast it's amazing.  Instead of viewing myself as looking for a GF or job at Google, I thought intead of a reality where they are seeking me, and then they did.  Immediately.  That to me is pretty strong evidence of parallel universes and creating your own reality by making conscious choices that somehow affect what happens to you.

                    The Government always needs a boogeyman.  Have you read Animal Farm by George Orwell?  It's a book about a farm with talking animals, where one of the pigs takes complete control of the other animals.  He has them working extremely hard to build a mill.  Then, when the mill is finally built, he has it torn down and blames Snowball, the rabbit from the beginning of the book who fled during the initial power struggle.  That's just off the top of my head.  But the main point of the book was showing how the person in power needs a bad guy to blame all their people's problems on, otherwise people with shitty lives will look to the government and blame the government.  So the government has to redirect this blame to a scapegoat.  That's the way it's always been.
                </p>
                <img src="static/img/terrorist.jpg" alt="terrorist" class="picfloat">
                <p>
                    In my lifetime, my government has blamed terrorism.  They blame terrorism for why they need to spend trillions on war and kill millions of people and breach all our privacy.  I think about 20 years after 9/11 people could see with their own eyes that there really aren't that many terrorists around.  That ISIS stuff wasn't really scaring anyone anymore, so they had to cook up a new boogeyman.  Enter coronavirus.  The new 9/11.  Basically nothing happened.  It was just a story in the news where some new virus sprung up in Wuhan.  Then it spreads across the world.  Whatever.  But no, we have to literally shut down businesses, school, get me fired from my job at the time, and put the entire would into a facemask for the majority of their day.  It's astronomically stupid.  People just went along with it.  I even had one of my best friends get on my case saying to "social distance" and "wash your hands" that was probably before the "wear a mask" was even pushed as the moral and scientific thing to do.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    The best thing about scaring everyone over a virus is that you cannot see a virus with the naked eye.  So although there is basically no virus, just like there is basically no terrorism, you have the idiot argument of it being invisible to the naked eye.  You know what?  The virus itself is naked to the eye but if this pandemic was real you would be able to see people sick with your naked eye.  You would hear people sneezing coughing, being too sick to go out on their birthday.  That's not what's happening.  If the goddamn news didn't exist, you wouldn't even know there was a pandemic.  It's complete and utter bullshit.  All I see with my own experience is healthy people in masks.  All I see is a dress code.  Healthy people keeping their distance from other healthy people, covering their healthy faces, and then rushing to get an experimental mRNA vaccine.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The people with brains who see no logical reason to get a vaccine are going to be tracked and targeted.  I just heard Oregon is already considering bringing these temporary restrictions into permanent law, and having a database track everyone who refuses vaccines.  How long before the non-vaxxed are treated like second-class citizens?  I'm healthy.  I feel fine.  I shouldn't be required to take a bullshit vaccine for a disease I'm not even afraid of.  If Covid gets me and I die so be it.  I'm not willing to wear a mask all day and socially distance.  Why don't you wear a helmet all day and when you're driving?  Technically that'd be much safer.  Who gives a shit.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    I bet you there are people who wear a mask in a car and don't wear a seatbelt.  I bet you that type of moron actually exists.

                    What's gov's plan with this?  A never-ending war against an invisable enemy?  A wonderful excuse to track everyone who isn't falling perfectly inline with your new world order.  It's just beyond me that people I know line up for the vaccine.  Have fun with your double masks, guys.  I heard it would be safer to wear 3.  You don't want to wear 3 masks?  Having trouble breathing?  You're putting grammie at risk you selfish bastard.  How dare you want to be able to breathe or smile.  So selfish.

                    It's spring break time in Miami and the government is trying to keep people from leaving their homes, basically.  There is a curfew enforced under the guise of coronavirus.  If you turn on the news about Miami they'll just show footage of a guy with a breathing tube in a hospital in miami and then cut to the crowds and talk about how irresponsible spring breakers are and how Miami is having a rise in cases.  It's a complete lie, how people don't see it is another topic entirely.

                    These spring breakers want to have fun.  The government is ready with military police with batons and crowd dispersing technology to prevent them from enjoying themselves.  That's what's happening.  Nobody wants this evil government's protection because there is simply no threat!   We can handle a couple terrorists in a cave in afganistan and a new coronavirus.  It's not that big of a deal.  With a military on 1/100th of the budget and with no covid restricitons we'd all still be alive and probably much better off.

                    I really don't like my last post.  I was frustrated and tired when I wrote it.
                </p>
                <p class="verse">
                    Matthew 23:12 For whoever exalts himself will be humbled, and whoever humbles himself will be exalted.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Jesus gave an example of this where he said when you stay at a friend's house you should take the least auspicious seat in the house.  When your friend sees you sitting in a humble seat he will say, "Friend, I have a better seat for you" and you will be honored in front of all the guests.  On the other hand, if when you go to your friend's house you grab the best seat you can find, your friend will come and say, "you have to move to make room for someone else."
                </p>
                <p>
                    That's a pretty badass way to go about things, if you ask me.  Maybe Jesus knows that it's human nature to build up the humble and to knock down the exalted.

                    He's giving sage advice and I wish I could listen better.

                    It's really hard for me to not brag about how smart I am, because I want people to listen to me about what I think is going on.

                <p>
                    Instead, I will try my best to humbly explain my beleifs, and then maybe if they have merit I can help someone else reach the same truth.

                <h4>My humble opinion</h4>
                <p>
                    I've heard there are around 50 people who survived both the Las Vegas shooting and the Borderline Shooting.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I know where Borderline is.  I've driven by it many times and I almost went there once because of the girl I liked at the time.  She was my prettiest facebook friend and I sent her a song and asked her out and she said yes.  That's probably the only time that's ever worked hahaha but she really was something else.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    She ended up moving somewhere so I didn't go to Borderline with her.  Anyway, what are the chances of being shot at in Las Vegas and then also shot at at Borderline?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Is it possible these events are fake and they are reusing the same crisis actors?

                    This guy, Mike Cronk, is being interviewed after surviving the mass shooting.  He is alone with a microphone!  There is even a clip of him grabbing the microphone from the reporter, and they let him do it.  It's insane.  Then he says "My Buddy" got shot.  He never says the name of his friend.  It's so bizarre.  He says "My Buddy" like 50 times and never mentions a first name?  I'd be like, "My buddy Jim"  you know?  Also him taking the mic is so bizarre.  He's like a real pro.  Any normal person would let the reporter hold the mic and talk when he's asked questions only.  Not just grab the mic and steal the show.  It's so fucking weird man.  I don't have an explanation for you I'm just pointing out how strange his behavior is.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    Here's the video of him snatching the mic.  It's actually funny.  Then he does more bizarre things.  They say he's an ex-teacher.  The guy's built like a truck and looks more ex-military than "retired teacher."  The reporter tells Mike what happened to Mike and then Mike says, "True".  The reporter even implies that mike is being too casual and then mike starts to cry on queue.  It's so fucking weird man.  Who is this guy?  They say they found him on the street, head in his hands, and shirtless because he used his shirt to stop the bleeding of his friend. 
                </p>

                    Now he's got a shirt on, he's grabbing the mic telling the story casually and not even naming his friend who's bleeding out somewhere.  I would be pretty eager to leave the interview and go with my "buddy" to the hospital and that's where my focus would be.  This guy is focused on giving a good performance and that's it.
                </p>
                <p>This guy is now a politician, so it's pretty clear to me he was rewarded for his fake story with a seat at the table.</p>
                <p>
                    People get offended when other people suggest events like this are fake.  It's considered insensitive.  I guess if I was involved in a real shooting I would be upset if people said it was fake, but I'm not sure.  If I was a survivor of real gunfire, and I was interviewed about it and people said my interview was fake, would I really be that offended?  I don't know.  If I had a loved one or friend die in front of me and was interviewed about it and people said I was lying would I be offended?  I don't think I would care.  I wouldn't even give interviews!  I would go home a lock my self in my room for weeks. These actors just immediately go on camera and are eager to share their story.  It's fucking weird, man.  It really is. "We thought it was fireworks" Shut the fuck up.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm gonna try to examine the reality of these mass shootings without offending the families of the victims if they were real.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I admit that it doesn't make sense to have a bunch of crisis actors running around keeping their mouths shut.  Within the normal version of reality, the idea of crisis actors doesn't really fit.  How could they be kept quiet?  How are entire lives used for just one event?  Did the kids really die in Sandy Hook or were they just fake pictures?  The theory of crisis actors just doesn't add up.  However, when you watch some of these interviews the people are clearly acting.  It's bizarre.
                </p>
                <p>
                    On the one hand, it would be impossible for a secret society to pull off these fake events and have a bunch of fake crisis actors keep quiet.  On the other hand, you have actors clearly faking,  or pictures recycled for different children, or just plain bad actors.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So the only explanation is to turn reality upside down and throw it out the window.  It's possible there are shapeshifters.  It's possible that not all people are the same.  These "Crisis Actors" could just be a few shapeshifters posing as real people.  Anything is on the table to explain how they have all these crisis actors.
                </p>

                    There's nothing real about this lady.  She is reading from a script and more focused on pushing gun control than mourning her son.  It's bizarre and just plain bad acting.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Was she at one point a real person with a real life and then they just killed her, cloned her, and had her do this clip?  Is this a shapeshifter taking her form and she's tied up somewhere?  Is she totally real and has just been brainwashed by the media to demand gun control?  Did she write this script herself of was it handed to her with some money under the table?  I don't know, but I do know that Robert Downey Jr. is more authentic as Iron Man then she is about mourning her son.  Is the son even dead, did they even exist before this?  I don't know, but all I know is she's serving the agenda of the media.  I don't know if she was hypnotized or what.  Anything is on the table except for this being a real interview from a real mom about a real son getting shot.

                <p>Then we have my favorite actor, Gene Rosen, who allegedly sheltered kids from the Sandy Hook shooting.</p>
                <p>
                    This guy is 100% lying about his experience sheltering kids from the shooter.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I get that it doesn't make sense that our government would pay him to lie about this but I'm just saying he is clearly lying.  It's not possible to watch these clips in a vaccumm and think they are real.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Is he just a failed actor who was approched and told, "look we have a part for you in a new fake school shooting.  All you have to do is get interviewed and make up a story about hearing the shots and seeing kids and taking them into your home.  We'll pay your 500K per year for the rest of your life if you keep quiet and if you talk we will kill your whole family.  Sign here.

                <p>
                    That scenario just doesn't make sense, and yet, here he is on video, more full of shit then a contruction site's portapotty.

                    I was going to keep my previous posts unedited for authenticity, but I'm going to go back and tweak some of them just to humble myself.  I don't want to exalt myself so I will be humbled.  I want to humble myself so I will be exalted.

                    Fake News
                </h4>
                <p>
                    You know what you'll never hear on a newscast?
                </p>
                <p>Here are tonight's top stories:</p>
                <p>
                    Coronavirus cases are at an all time low, looks like our immune system is winning the battle and adapting faster then the virus can adapt to new strains. We should be able to take our masks off and get rid of social distancing now.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The world is safer this year than it was last year so we'll be reducing our military spending by 2 trillion dollars this year and donating it to homeless shelters.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A recent study has shown that people are evolving and want peace.  We do not forsee any major wars in the future.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In other news, the lack of terrorist attacks for over a decade have cause the US to rethink it's military occupation of the middle east.  We found no weapons of mass destruction so we'll be pulling back the troops and ending wars around the world.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This just in, the coronavirus experimental vaccine does not prevent you from catching the disease or passing it on and it also doesn't allow you to take your mask off so there's actually no benefit to taking it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In other news, scientists are now considering the light in the sky called the moon is actually a light instead of just a rock reflecting light.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Also it's been more than 50 years since we said we walked on the moon, perhaps that mission was faked.
                </p>
                <p>
                    And finally, the voyager sent out into space somewhere around pluto has run out of batteries or malfunctioned and no one is there to repair it so it will no longer be sending back signals to earth on old technology.  Sharon?  Back to you.

                <p>This is part of a documentary that shows how the TV footage on 9/11 was faked.</p>
                <p>
                    For example, the nose of the plane travels through the building and then the camera fades to black in an attempt to hide the mistake.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you think about it as a false flag it makes more sense to use a missile disguised as a plane or to use a bomb then it does to actually risk using inexperienced hijackers to pilot into the tower.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    It's difficult for me to even wrap my mind around what people think happened.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It's not possible to watch these 10 minutes without understanding the footage was faked.
                </p>
                <h4>
                    Moving on
                </h4>
                <p>
                    I don't know why people think 9/11 was as reported.  I don't think anyone my age is changing their mind either.
                </p>
                <p>
                    No one wants to talk about it and I'm the bad guy for bringing it up or accusing the government and the media.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I think the reason people cannot understand it was not as reported is because they lack a suitable substitute explanation.  I'm comfortable with abandoning what I know is wrong, even if there is no satisfactory alternative.  I'll just research it until I figure it out.  I like figuring things out.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    In chess I am in the top 1000 players.  But I really don't have the talent to be number 1 or even the desire.  My only desire is to understand the moves the number 1 player makes.  And even the google supercomputer when it plays chess, I want to understand it and appreciate it's genius.
                </p>
                <img src="static/img/hunting.jpg" alt="hunting" class="picfloat">
                <p>
                    I'm like Mozart's composer friend or Will Hunting's professor except I'm not bitter that I'm not the best.  I'm just glad I'm able to understand the best.
                </p>
                <p>
                    That problem that he's solving on the blackboard?  I'm the type of person that researches exactly what problem he's solving. And spends a whole day solving it myself.  Do I get paid for that?  No.  But that's just what I do.  I figure shit out.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In chess for example, I just lost a couple games in a row because of time trouble.  I realize that I really enjoy the complexity of chess and I like searching for the best move and understanding why it is the best. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm not as interested in beating my opponent as I am with understanding the best moves.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If 9/11 was real there would be remastered high-definition video of the planes hitting their spots.  Instead we have a bunch of crap.  There would also be perhaps helicopters rescuing people from the roof.
                </p>

                <p>
                    When the building's were hit, they just stood there smoking, and then I don't think anyone expected them to completly collapse and be eviscerated.  Did you really think they were going to crumble into dust?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Planes hit.  Building remains standing.  Smokes, some fires.  Then complete and utter collapse into itself at near-freefall speed.  They were suddenly pulverized.  It makes no sense.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Planes didn't even hit and they certainly didn't bring down the buildings.  If planes had the ability to bring down a building then the building would immediately collapse from the impact of the plane.  like boom.  It makes no sense to take the hit, stand there for 15 minutes, and then collapse due to the fires.  Fires don't cause an entire skyscraper to collapse like that.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I really don't know what to say.  I'm not even trying to convince anyone anymore.  It is what it is.  For whatever reason, people just don't get it.  There remains the possiblity that I'm wrong and everyone believing CNN is right, but then why am I so smart in other objective areas?  Shouldn't you be able to beat me on a math test, or a chess game?  Shouldn't I be somewhat retarded to believe something so insane?  Like how does this make any sense guys.  Shouldn't I be drooling down my shirt?  Shouldn't I be stupid and not understand physics or math or anything applicable to what happened on 9/11?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Shouldn't I not be able to read a book?  Shouldn't I not have a college degree?  Shouldn't I not have a job?  Why do I think what the tinfoil hat wearing conspiracy theorists think?  How does that make any sense.  Why do I consistently test in the 99th percentile in basically any subject, and then the moment I try to disagree with someone they think I'm the one who is incorrect?  Why is that?  Why am I not allowed to teach anyone anything?  Did you know the only people I've ever taught anything have been little children in a classroom?  Adults are completely incapable of learning anything from me.  It's makes no difference what I know; I'm simply not allowed to teach anyone anything because no one lets me explain anything.  They would rather call me crazy.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm not crazy.  I'm telling you reality is fucking weird.  It's alive.  It's a liar.  It's not normal.  It's not static.  It's fluid and dynamic and it comes from us instead of us coming from it.  You all have it completely backwards and upside down.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Every single thing you've been told is a bonafide lie.  Literally none of it is true.  I know because I can jump into any subject and understand it well enough to know it's not true.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The moon, for example, makes no logical sense.  We are told it lights up the night because it reflects the rays of the sun.  That doesn't make any sense.  It's obviously a light source.  You cannot just have a rock sphere with a surface of dust reflect light like a frickin mirror.  It's glowing!  Nothing makes sense if you really think about it.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    I could be wrong about the moon.  I'm willing to change my mind.  I only just starting thinking about it because of the audiobook I'm reading by Quantum of Conscience.  But, it certainly looks like a light.
                </p>
                <h4>The Devil Symbology</h4>
                <p>
                    I was watching Spiderman 1 recently, the Sam Raimi version with Tobey Mcguire, and the movie was buffering.  While it was buffering, I scanned the new york background, the signs.  999 was huge on a sign.  That is 666 upside down, the number of the beast.  Then later when Mary Jane is walking down a dark alley, she walks by a sign that is literally a red pentagram, a symbol of the devil.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    These are things I only caught because I was looking for them and it froze to buffer.  Do I think Sam Raimi wanted an upside down 666 and a pentagram in those scenes?  No.  Did a producer sneak it into the background?  Maybe.  Was it just mandela effected and put in there later?  I don't know.  But I highly doubt it's just a bunch of humans in a cabaal.  It's not natural.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    Somehow, this satanic symbology seeps into everything we consume.  I don't understand it fully, but I think it is supernatural.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    I do not think life is boring.  I think life is a fascinating experience where somehow the devil is controlling it and God is letting him.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    I think people have goals and their brains filter out what isn't helping them achieve their goals so if your goal is not to understand the nature of reality you will not be able to see any of this.

                <p>I just reached a rating of 2064 in classical chess on lichess.org.  That's ranked 985th in the world.</p>
                <p>
                    Classical chess means the time control with the most amount of time.  I usually play 30 minute games with zero time increment (time added per move).
                </p>
                <p>
                    The more time I have the better I am able to do.  
                </p>
                <p>In this game I played a queens gambit accepted where I took the pawn and tried to hold onto it.</p>
                <p>
                    I didn't just grab it immediately and then try to defend it.  I planned ahead and prepared taking it by using the Caro Kahn defense by playing c6.  Then when I take on c4 I have b5 supported by the pawn on c6.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I also bring my bishop out and exchange off his knight to further control the b5 square so I can always have a pawn protecting the pawn on c4.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Normally white tries to take back the pawn on c4 with an attack but in this game it backfired.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Then I hopped my knight into a great position and had the opportunity to take his bishop.  However, I decided to leave my strong knight there and then he lashes out in an uncomfortable postion which blunders my knight fork.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After winning the exchange I trade knights and have an opportunity to win his bishop with 17. b5
                </p>
                <p>
                    That would trap his bishop and probably force resignation but instead I quickly played c5 which was my only mistake in the game.  I played it because I wanted to get my bishop some scope and also I saw that the pawn storm would become overwhelming to my opponent.
                </p>
                <p>
                    c5 is a good move but it's not winning a piece the way b5 would have.
                </p>
                <p>At this level, even when you're dominating your opponent in a won position, they're going to recognize that they cannot win a long game and throw everything at your king to try to force checkmate.</p>
                <p>
                    I see the threats coming and decide to go take a pawn with my queen anyway because I'm not too worried about it and thought I was adequately defended.
                </p>
                <p>
                    However on move 27.Qg4 I realized he's threatening to play Bxh6 and then checkmate on the next move with Qxg7.  I cannot take the bishop because the Queen pins my pawn to my king.  So for that reason I slide over with Kh8.
                </p>
                <p>
                    On that move is when I started thinking, "What if he plays Bxh6 anyway to open up his rook and queen?"
                </p>
                <img src="static/img/bishopsac.png" alt="bishop sacrifice" class="pic13">
                <p>
                    I would have to play gxh6 to stop the original mating idea with queen and bishop. But taking with the g pawn in that direction opens up the follow up move Rf3! threatening mate in one with Rxh6.
                </p>
                <img src="static/img/rooklift.png" alt="rook lift" class="pic13">
                <p>
                    Within that variation I was calculating how to defend against Rxh6 when he played 28.Bd4? instead of 28.Bxh6 and at that point the game is over because I'm no longer getting mated in any variation.  Really bad move by him and I guess he either didn't spot Rh3 or he did spot it and he also spotted my miraculous defense.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you try to defend h6 with the king by playing Kh7 after Rf3 then he has Qf4 piling up on the h6 pawn and successfully attacking my king.  Computer says that variation is a draw or even.
                </p>
                <p>
                    However after Rf3! I have Qc5+ and after king moves I have Qe3 defending h6 and threatening Qg5 stopping everything.
                </p>
                <img src="static/img/queendefend.png" alt="queen defense" class="pic13">
                <p>
                    That's an incredible defensive resource that makes it -16 in favor of black but it is the only move to defend against the Bxh6 Rf3 combination.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I didn't have time to find it in the game because he played something else but I'm not sure I would have found it because it's basically facing checkmate in one move and yet calculating two queen moves that save the day because of check.  The Queen on c6 looks so out of position to stop the attack on the king however it can swing around the back with a check and solve all my problems.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    Disappointing that my opponent didn't play that, but it shows the danger of playing someone at this level.  Even in a game where almost everything went right for me I was still in some serious danger.
                </p>

                    Will I hit 2100?  I don't know but I'm only a few consecutive wins away.  I've mostly been beating up on 1900s and low 2000s but I think I'll have to beat a 2100 to become 2100.

                    Like Neo in the Matrix, sooner or later, someone has to beat an agent.

                <h3>03/19/2021</h3>
                <p>
                    Once upon a time, there was a society that had a scoreboard with everyone's name on it and a number next to it.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    Points are awarded for making money, buying cool things, and having sex.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    Each sex act accomplished is multiplied by the 1-10 hotness of your partner and added onto your total.
                </p>
                <img src="static/img/sohot.jpg" alt="sohot" class="pic100">
                <p>
                    Points are awarded for driving a nice car, or having a nice house, or having a hot girlfriend.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Points are awarded for having lots of friends, throwing parties, and having a good career.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The more points you score, the more successful the society thinks you are.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There is a man named Henry who has lots of points.  3063 to be exact.  He had a long career as a stockbroker.  He had 2 sports cars, a beach house, a hot wife and a hotter mistress.  He had parties and many followers on instagram.  Great Gatsby would take notice.  At 63, Henry had a heart attack during one of his lavish parties, and passed out on the dance floor.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Then, he wakes up and he's at the gates of heaven.  He gets up, and walks on a cloud.  He shivers; he is cold without a jacket.  He sees Jesus, wearing a jacket.  He asks Jesus, "Please can I have your jacket?"  "No"  Jesus says. Jesus continues, "For when I was cold and asked you for a jacket you turned me away."  Henry says,"No, I wouldn't do that to you, Jesus."  Jesus says back, "You already have, on Earth.  You never clothed any homeless who were cold and needed your jacket.  If you had, you would have been clothing me."
                </p>
                <p>
                    Henry is sad.  "Do I get to go to heaven?"  Jesus opens the book he's carrying.  Let's see... Henry Hypothetical... You scored 49 points on Earth.  You need 1000 to get into Heaven, sorry."   Henry objects, "But I had 3063 points on Earth!"  Jesus looks at him matter-of-factly, "We keep score differently up here."  
                </p>
                <p>
                    Henry wakes up from his heart attack at one of his parties with a bunch of his "friends" around him.  He tells everyone to leave and he thinks about his life and how there are actually 2 different scoreboards, and only the one in heaven is important to him now.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    The next day, Henry no longer cares how society keeps his score.  He quits his job and gives his possessions away.  Society deducts so much points from him he starts to go negative. His girlfriend leaves him.  He is considered a failure.  He reads the Bible and tries to show some of it to his friends, and share his experience, but most of his "friends" avoid him now.  At 88, Henry dies at peace, and wakes up in heaven with a warm jacket on this time.  The angel's are singing his name and Jesus helps him up and points to the scoreboard.  It reads, "Henry Hypothetical: 4004". Jesus says, "I am giving away some of my possessions to you, because you have already done the same for me."  Henry smiles.  Jesus hands him a golden steering wheel, and a golden key.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Henry drives his invisible car through the clouds and to his heavenly house.  And the angels sing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The End.  Here is the Bible verse that I got the idea for the story from:

                        34 “Then the King will say to those on his right, ‘Come, you who are blessed by my Father; take your inheritance, the kingdom prepared for you since the creation of the world. 35 For I was hungry and you gave me something to eat, I was thirsty and you gave me something to drink, I was a stranger and you invited me in, 36 I needed clothes and you clothed me, I was sick and you looked after me, I was in prison and you came to visit me.’

                <p>
                    I have a very special post for you today.  It is a wonderful new theory that explains an awful lot of this riddle we call life.  I'm going to share how I got here before I can share the recruitment theory properly.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I used to think everything was normal here.  Maybe some corruption here and there, but I generally believed what I was told about how the world works.  Then around 2010, My friend I'll call Jokir invited me and my friends to his house to watch a documentary.  It was Loose Change, and it made a case that 9/11 was an inside job.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    Many debunkers have since discredited that documentary, but the damage was already done to my psyche.  I had already opened my mind to the possiblity that maybe 9/11 did not happen in the way we were told.  Even if the conclusions Dylan Avery (The filmmaker) was making were wrong, or the evidence he was using was later debunked, the theme of documentary resonated with me.  Maybe America wasn't attacked by Bin Laden, maybe an event as important as this was thought out and part of some sort of plan, and Bin Laden was a cover story.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Over time, I became obsessed with figuring out exactly what happened.
                </p>
                <p>
                    5 years later, I concluded that there were no planes.  The footage was faked, and the buildings were exploded and demolished by bombs.
                </p>
                <div class="vid">

                </div>
                <p>
                    That's a 30 second clip of a man saying, "No Plane, it was a bomb."  There was a better clip I was looking for of someone saying the same thing but this clip is still enough to make you want to scratch your head.  Why would someone definitively say there was no plane but a bomb?  It's weird.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After discovering the no plane theory and the documentary "September Clues" which shows how the footage was faked, I was satisfied with my explanation.  I didn't have the desire to research anymore.  Researching all that death is a form of torture.
                </p>
                <p>
                    5 years after that, my friend Jokir recommends to me a youtube channel called "Quantum of Conscience".  I immediately liked his perspective, and I started following him closely.  He has an audiobook called, "A Reality Few Can See" that he started the channel with, and I am in the middle of reading it.  He also came to the no planes conclusion and then moved on.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    During one of the readings of the chapters, he recommends listening to someone's complement or rebuttal to one of his videos.  He called it brilliant.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I listened to this rebuttal and this is that video:
                </p>
                <p>
                    *Spoiler Alert* If you haven't read 1984 or do not remember how it ends I have to warn you that he does spoil the book in this video.  It's the best book or ending to a story I've ever read so it pains me to spoil it for you but it's so important I have to discuss it.
                </p>

                    Basically this man suggests that the 9/11 event was done at the time the internet could handle it.  He says that there is an iniation going on with different filters, and that no plane theory would be the final filter of 9/11.  He says that when certain people are seperated from their peers as they peel back layers of the veil, these groups are then targeted.  Not killed, but recruited, and if unsuccessfully recruited, then disabled by whatever means necessary.

                <p>
                    My favorite story in the Bible is the story of Job, because it shows a different dynamic to the Devil and God then we usually think about.  The story goes that Job loves God and has a good life.  Satan challenges God and says, "He only loves you because his life is good.  If you made his life terrible he would curse you." God accepts the challenge and starts making Job's life miserable with diseases, etc.  Job loves God even though his circumstances change, and God basically wins the bet and rewards Job in Heaven.  I'm paraphrasing but that's the jist of it.  Job was patient with God and trusted him and was rewarded and the Devil was proven wrong.

                    If you think of yourself as Job, then you are put through the ringer with this 9/11 truth movement, and everyone thinking you're crazy.  You have to research more and more, to be absolutely certain you're right, otherwise it's not worth the trouble.  Eventually, you prove it to yourself enought to believe it and move on, but not before the torture is done.

                <p>
                    Now in order to tie this all in together I have to spoil 1984.  The main character Winston Smith knows something is wrong with society.  He wants to fight against it, and he rebels by writing a journal where the telescreen can't see him.  "Down with Big Brother" he writes.  A treasonous thought.  The thought police can take you away for writing that.  He works at the Ministry of Truth, where he rewrites history and old newspapers with whatever fits today's politics.  Something like that.  I haven't read it in years, but it's making me think of the Mandela Effect a little bit.  I can't believe I'm giving a synopsis of the greatest book of all time but here it goes.  He hates a girl because she represents a loyal Party member.  Then she passes him a note that says "I love you" and he realizes it's a facade.  They have a secret affair in the attic of an old shop.  He makes a friend name O'Brien who gives him a book and offers to have him join "The Resistance".  The book, is written by William Goldstein and is like the bible of the resistance group that is trying to take down Big Brother.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    Eventually, Winston and his lover, I think Julia, are found in the attic.  The shopkeeper below, letting them use the attic for unlawful sex, was actually a member of the thought police.  No love was allowed because love was reserved for the Party or something, I forget why exactly.  But their love was forbidden and therefore extra special.  When Winston is taken into custody, O'Brien is there to greet him.  It turns out, and this is the grand twist, that O'Brien is not a member of the resistance.  There is no resistance.  The Book by Emmanuel Goldstein, was fake.  O'Brien, who recruited Winston into the resistance, was with the thought police the whole time.  O'Brien explains everything to Winston, and how they have total control of people's reality.  2+2=5 if they want it to be.  The whole time I was reading the book I thought it would end with the resistance winning, like in a normal story.  But in this story, Big Brother Wins.  O'brien brings in Julia, and Rats in a cage.  Winston is terrified of rats, and O'brien is threatening to put his head in a cage with hungry rats.  Winston finally cries out, "Not me, not me!  Do it to her!!"  and I think they listen to him.  Once his humanity and hope has been completely removed, they simply let Winston go.  Then he is drinking gin and has no plans to bring down Big Brother or break the rules.  By the end of the book, he loves Big Brother.  Big Brother wins.
                </p>
                <p>
                    These truth movements, are like the torture Winston went through, and their goal is to eventually turn truthers into O'Briens to help run the Party system.  Like the Devil in the story of Job, the nefarious actors here want the truther to curse God for the torture they are under, and join the dark side of the sith, basically, and to become an O'Brien.  Instead of trying to show others the trick, just join the tricksters.  Mark Twain said, "It is easier to fool a man than to convince a man he's been fooled."  Such is the nature of reality here.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    I myself had doors open up at both Google and Amazon.  It is quite interesting to imagine if those doors were opened up for me with the understanding that maybe I would walk through them and join the tricksters down the line.  I still have a Google recruiter named Brandon I could reach out to.  It's obviously possible I'm just not qualified for the job.  It wasn't like I didn't try to get it.  But it is possible that I had to make a choice:  To prepare for technical interviews, or to study what I wanted to study.  I don't know what happened but I just think this recruitment theory is interesting because look at what the Green Goblin does to Spiderman.  He doesn't try to kill spiderman, he tries to recrutit him.  Even the Joker plays his games with Batman almost like Satan and God arguing over what Job will do in the bible.

                    I should also mention that if you click on the articles tab and view my LinkedIn article about Google, you will see that it is me explaining that their "How to interview at Google" youtube video tutorial featured a wrong answer.  I pointed out the mistake and offered a superior answer, and then they interviewed me.  It's only just occuring to me now, that they purposefully put the wrong answer in that video, and are only interested in interviewing people who are able to see it.  They made the mistake on purpose.  I had barely started coding for less than a few months and I have interviews at Google and Amazon when there are CS majors that have way more experience than me and probably can't even sniff an interview at google.

                    If I get tired of trying to explain to you what I know in different ways, I am in danger of calling you "Sheep" and developing a hatred of you.  Then I am an easy target to be indirectly recruited into a system that takes advantage of someone like you.  I once had a sort of interview with an Advance Space AI lead person who made a strange comment to me in a bar.  He said, "If you say you want to make money, that will take you very far in this business".  And what business is that exactly?  Space exploration with AI?  Why would wanting to make money have anything to do with how high you are able to rise in space exploration.  Shouldn't it be intelligence, curiosity, and ingenuity?  Why would announcing that you want money, be the deciding factor?  Well, if space exploration is a fraud, and his business model is to trick investors into giving him money so he can fake a bunch of space shit, then in that scenario, and only in that scenario, his comment would make sense. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    My friends like to say that I think all the world is a show, and they aren't willing to go that far.  But guess what?  If 9/11 is fake, and everything else is real, that doesn't make any logical sense.  Either all of it's real, or none of it is.  I'm telling you, there's no logical way to think 9/11 was an inside job, but simultaneously believe in democracy, voting, the news, politicians, the moon landing, coronavirus, sandy hook, anything.  Literally all of it goes down the drain with the same "Reality Flush" as Matt from Quantum of Conscience would put it.

                <p>If they weren't trying to recruit truthers, they wouldn't have made it so obvious.  This theory explains all the breadcrumbs they leave for people to chase.  There are mistakes that they allow as an initiation.  A singed passport of a terrorist when the black boxes can't even survive the explosion... things like that are mistakes on purpose.</p>
                <p>The Illuminati are the "illuminated ones" who possess knowledge.  They have been through the initiation.</p>

                <h4>Futility</h4>
                <p>I could make a blog post explaining the basics of 9/11 or The Mandela Effect.  I could refine my approach and try a million different ways to persuade the person who thinks Osama Bin Laden did 9/11 or that the Mandela Effect is just misremembering.  This is perhaps worthwhile, however, it is mostly futile and therefore frustrating.  The problem with doing that is that I'm spinning my wheels.  There will always be people who cannot understand what I'm presenting because the conclusions I'm making do not fit their model of reality.  Sometimes, people will say, "So what?  Now What?  What if your right, what do we do?" Well, once we've all graduated from first grade we can move onto second grade.  I'm not going to teach anymore first grade classes.  If you think it's always been "Magic Mirror" on the wall and everywhere it says "Mirror, Mirror" on the wall is a misprint or photoshopped, I'm sorry but you're going to have to be held back a year.  You will have to find a new first grade teacher because I'm moving onto second grade.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I do not enjoy teaching first grade classes over and over because I do not get a chance to teach anything advanced. What is second grade?  In this second grade class, I'm going to be sharing some theories about 9/11.  If you think Osama Bin Laden is responsible for that day then please go back to your first grade class and let me teach my other students.
                </p>

                <p>What a beautiful building.</p>
                <p>I wonder if they had the blueprints for this before they even executed their plan on 9/11</p>
                <p>I do think they knew ahead of time they would replace the two towers with one tower.</p>
                <p>
                    I think there's something significant about 2 becoming 1.
                    I can't say for sure but the first thing that pops to mind about 2 becoming 1 is 2 genders becoming one.  A genderless society.  A spectrum.  Another interesting thing about 911 is well, first of all, that's the number for an emergency which is probably not a coincidence.  More interestingly though, is considering that 9/11 is like counting, but skipping the number ten.  1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,11.  10 is the number of completion.  But on 9/11 the fun goes on.  Also 1 is an important number.  Like a One World Government.  They obliterated the twin towers, and erected one tower to rule them all.  It's symbolic of their triumph.  The 11 of 9/11 also looks like two towers.  Also, even 2001 is 2, then nothing, then 1.  2 towers, then nothing, then 1 tower.  I can also do this with linguistics.  Barack Hussein Obama?  Black Hussein Osama? First Black President. Sadaam Hussein. Osama Bin Laden.

                <p>
                    Most people have considered how an Alien Invasion would unite the species into a one world government to combat the aliens.  The One World government idea can be good or bad depending on what kind of government it is.  It could be that having different governments throughout the world is the best stragegy for the whole.  A multi government world allows for people to compare and contrast and it protects against a tyranny enslaving everyone.  The downside is that some tyranny may still exist in some parts of the world and working together might not work as well as in a one government system.  I think given where we are at as a species, it's too risky to form a one world government right now, because governments are so sick that it would turn the whole world rotten.   I think the bad guys right now would prefer a one world government, and are hatching plans to bring about it's existence.  And by bad guys I don't necessarily mean people in secret societies.  I just mean whoever is responsible for these plots and deceptions, humans or non-humans.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    I think of how a fake crisis could be used to unite the world into a one world dystopia.  Coronavirus is doing just that.  The whole world is coming together to fight this bullshit virus.  Maybe they're starting out slow, and will crank up the deaths when it suits them, but I think it's pretty clear they created the virus, released it, and are capitalizing on it's spread by uniting the world into a one world government. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Remember, this is a second grade class.  If you think the virus came from a bat by accident please go back to your first grade class.  I'm sure they're very worried about you.  Teaching second grade is fun!  I can actually build on assumptions that would normally be challenged by my first grade class.  Like Evolution, instead of challenging evolution I can begin to build on the idea that evolution is untrue.  It's like as a game designer, if some people can't get past level 1, should I work on making level 1 more accessible or should I just build level 2?  In this post, I'm working on level 2 and saying that I've done the best I can with level 1, and you can either beat it or give up.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm actually new to challenging evolution so I don't have anything interesting to say about the consequences of it being untrue.  I think certain parts of it are believable, and others aren't.  I will think about it and get back to you.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The bell's about to ring.  How to conclude this second grade class?  I will answer the question of "So what? Now what?"  I would say that it's very important to not watch the news or react to basically anything being told to us.  Now that we in second grade have internalized that the entire media lies about basically everything, it is our responsibility to never take them seriously again about anything.  It's also interesting to ponder what's really going on here.  They can't all be in on it, and yet they all say the same nonsense.  It's bizarre.  Sure, Anderson Cooper's in on it, but somehow this reality is constructed to where people are unknowingly doing the devil's work.  I don't know how else to explain it.  If the news says a comet is coming to blow up your town, I would advise to look up into the sky and use your own eyes.  Just go about your day, and if you see it coming directly for you with your own eyes, dive out of the way.  But the idea that you can get anything useful from the media is just ridiculous at this point.  All they do is push lies until it is seen as normal.  That's it.  They're liars.  The ones who aren't lying, have been tricked by the liars, and are repeatign the information the liars put out.  You would be welcome on CNN to talk about how serious the virus is, but the minute you say something logical of your own self like, "Hey, shouldn't we be talking about ways to strengthen the immune system, how that's our best defense for thousands of years, and how masks actually compromise the immune sytem?"  If you were on CNN as one of the non-liar parrots, and said that, you would be cut off, edited out, shunned, and fired.  It's just ridiculous how full of shit the media is.  And people know it's full of shit, even first graders know.  But first graders think the media is lying because they lean left, or lean right.  No, sorry first graders, that isn't what's happening at all.  That's the excuse they use for when it's obviously bullshit.  They are pure liars.  Their jobs are to discuss nonsense and treat it as important so that nothing important ever gets discussed.

                <h4>Anderson Pooper Scooper</h4>
                <img src="static/img/cooper.jpg" alt="cooper" class="pic13">
                <p>
                    Anderson Pooper Scooper is like the secret weapon of the CIA.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    He's so good at what he does even I want to fall for it sometimes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Instead of telling you what to believe, or what he thinks, he will typically be interviewing someone else.
                </p>
                <p>
                    During these interviews, he will always be concerned, and mostly asking questions, as if genuinely trying to understand the story.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, the subtext of what he does is making it seem real, official, and true.  He will also address any countering theories to the news story as fake, hurtful, and absurd.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I just pulled up a recent interview of him and Bill Gates to see what method's he is using.  In the parts I just skimmed, Anderson Cooper is laughing like a happy-go-lucky kind of guy.  I'm sure he's actually buds with Bill and they're part of the same club of evil people.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    The parts of the interview I just stomached were about how Bill spends billions of dollars trying to reduce greenhouse gasses and prevent carbon from entering the atmosphere.  He's making plant-based meat and he is injecting carbon into cement so it can't go into the ozone or whatever.  Listen, if Bill Gates was actually a good person and philanthropist he would actually do things we could understand.  This interview is clearly pushing the idea of climate change and how we have to stop it.  Listen, there's millions of people right now that are in debt, hungry, homeless, etc. 
                </p>
                <img src="static/img/vax.jpg" alt="vax" class="pic13">
                <p>
                    We don't need your bullshit vaccinations and climate change fighting tactics.  It's pure evil bullshit.  It he was really a good person, he would simply build a gigantic homeless shelter that is completely free, and helps the homeless get off of drugs and alcohol, cuts their hair and puts them in suits and sets up job interviews.  Instead, this snake will actually go into the poorest parts of the world and inject them with a vaccine, which is basically just a tenuated disease,  and then leave them penniless and hungry and vaccinated.  It's a fucking joke. He's pure evil.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Again this is for second graders.  If you think Bill Gates is doing the best he can with his fortune please go back to your first grade class.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    Bill Gates could dissolve his fortune amongst us all equally if he's such a good guy.  Bill can afford to pay everyone in the world $20.  So do it Bill, and then fuck off, seriously.  How can you look at a third world country and say, "You know what they need?  Vaccines!"  Some of the kids will die from the side effects.  Build them a house, you asshole!  Give them food, water, shelter, and clothes, and love.  They don't want your fucking chemicals.  What a piece of shit, I mean seriously, it's not complicated.  There is no scientific debate on hunger or homelessness.  We need food and shelter.  What we don't need is injecting carbon dioxide into concrete to prevent it from going into the atmosphere.  What a joke.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    So ya, that's Anderson Pooper Scooper's job.   To interview Bill Gates, push climate change and vaccines, and make them both look like great guys doing it.  And he's the best they have.  
                </p>
                <p>If you're so concerned about third world people getting diseases maybe you should use your billions of dollars to build them houses and feed them so they can build a strong immune system.  How about you plant some orange trees, you asshole.  Class dismissed. </p>

                <h3>03/13/2021</h3>
                <h4>Taxation</h4>
                <img src="static/img/Benz.jpg" alt="Benz" class="pic11">
                <p>
                    The United States Government is $28 trillion dollars in debt.  That's $85,000 for every person in the country, which is less than I thought.  Maybe they should track how much each person has spent in their life in taxes to the government, and when you contribute your 85K, you're free on income tax.  Then maybe everyone would pay their 85 and we could be a debt free nation.  All you have to do is buy the government a Mercedes Benz AMG GT.
                </p>
                <p>
                    They are in debt to the "Federal Reserve" which has been ruled by the courts as a private bank.  When you pay your income taxes to the government, how much of that money does the government use to pay off it's debt to the Federal Reserve?
                </p>
                <p>
                    If the government was not in debt, and we paid the amount of taxes we pay now, we would probably expect to see some useful things done with our money.  But because of the insurmountable debt, they basically give the money to a private bank and we get nothing for our federal income tax dollars.  
                </p>
                <h4>War</h4>
                <img src="static/img/war.jpeg" alt="war" class="pic11">
                <p>
                    The United States Government has the strongest military in the world.  If Big Joe is the strongest kid on the playground and owes little timmy $10, who does the $10 really belong to?  In other words, does the US Government use it's military to control the world, regardless of how much debt it is in?  After all, they could just go in and blowup the Federal Reserve bank and kill them all and declare themselves free of debt, right?  Well, see the government and the federal reserve are working together.  It's the peasants like you and me that are getting screwed.  See we pay our income to the government, and then the government gives it to the bank and says they don't have enough money to give us anything back.  Meanwhile the private bank gets all the money, and only lends it out to the governments it controls, with interest.  
                </p>
                <h4>The Devil Farmer</h4>
                <img src="static/img/lucifer.jpg" alt="lucifer" class="pic11">

                <p>
                    See, this isn't a free country, and it's not a representative democracy.  The 2004 Presidential election was between two members of the same college fraternity Skull and Bones.  
                </p>
                <p> We only think we are free, and have only as much limited freedom as is benificial to the 1% exploiting the other 99%.  Imagine a Devil Farmer with a bunch of cows and chickens.  He cares nothing about the animals except profit.  He is ripping them apart and selling them and keeping them in small cages.  Then he realizes, if he makes their cage larger, they produce better quality meat he can sell at a higher price.  The Devil Farmer then enlarges their cages, not out of consideration for the animals, but out of the same heartless profit seeking he started with.  Imagine he continues expanding their cage until the perfect economic equilibrium where if he gives them any change in freedom it reduces profit.  That is where we are.  We are the cows and the Devil Farmer is the US of A.</p>
                <h4>The Game of Money</h4>
                <img src="static/img/money.jpg" alt="money" class="pic11">

                <p>
                    We are expected to work like slaves, basically, entering the workforce in debt if you went to college, and then pay a large part of our income to the government who pays the banks and gives us nothing to show for our contribution.  So you are welcome to play this game and even make good money, but you should realize it is a rigged game and you are a peasant.  I have been studying Latin and my last name "Jann" translates to "Carl" in Latin.  "Carl" is defined in english as "a peasant or man of low birth."  So I am Max Jann, the Greatest of Men of Low Birth, according to Latin, which by the way, is on all the money.
                </p>
                <h4>Economic Priests</h4>
                <img src="static/img/priest.jpg" alt="priest" class="pic11">

                <p>
                    Credit to Bill Cooper's video on my blog about the federal reserve for the following insight:  Throughout history the minority has exploited the majority for wealth.  Look at ancient kings and queens.  They convinced their people they were Gods.  When that stopped working, they employed a priest class whose job was to convince the people that rulers are chosen by God and bad rulers are chosen by God as punishment and rebellion against them is a rebellion against God.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When that stopped working, they employed intellectuals to proclaim that this system is the best we can do, and it is just.   The modern intellectual economists serve the same function as the priest class did before.  They convince the 99% to allow the 1% to keep fucking them over.  99% vs. 1% is a fight we can win physically, so the 1% has to employ all these tricks to keep the 99% divided and too stupid to rise up against the 1%.  The smaller the percentage of the exploiting class, the more profitable it is.  If 50% exploited 50%, it wouldn't be enough to sustain them.  
                </p>
                <h4>Solution</h4>
                <p>
                    All we have to do, is destroy the federal reserve banking system, declare America bankrupt, and start over.  There's no reason you should have to work 40 hours a week just to feed and clothe yourself.  It's ridiculous.  We are being exploited by a spiderweb system of lies and deception.  
                </p>

                    If the government actually took our tax dollars and built cool things for us with it do you have any idea how many cool free things we'd have?  Instead we have War, and some social security money and a crappy healthcare plan that makes you choose between taking a scalpel to your eye or spending 3 Grand on a laser to do it for you for cataract surgery.

                    The Military probably works for the private central bank unknowingly.  If it was actually controlled by an elected representitive, we would simply elect someone who promised to end this corrupt system.  The whole system is a lie for over 100 years since our currency became federal reserve notes instead of US notes.  A private bank controls all of us.  They can print up digital money on a computer without oversight.  They control basically the whole entire world.  And if they try to use other currencies in other countries to buy Oil in the middle east, we simply blow up our own buildings for an excuse to go fuck shit up in the middle east and force everyone to only be able to buy oil in dollars.  It's known as the Petrodollar, and that's the only thing giving the dollar any tangible value.  We will blow up anyone who tries to sell oil without using American dollars.  So the military works for the bank.

                <h2>Lorem Ipsum</h2>
                <h3>03/10/2021</h3>

                <p>When I'm coding, I can type "lorem" into visual studio code (my text editor)  and it will give me the option of hitting enter and creating a wall of text as follows:</p>
                <p>Lorem, ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Enim, voluptate quod, possimus facere iure iste consequatur quisquam odio fuga molestias distinctio rerum repudiandae? Assumenda nam quisquam, saepe voluptas accusamus voluptatum?</p>
                <p>
                    This is commonly used by coders and designers so they can see how their website looks with dummy text, basically.  It's a useful paragraph to use because most people can't read latin and yet you get to see how the words look within your design.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The funny thing is, when you're as curious as I am, you want to know what the translation is.  It turns out its sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I've been fooling around with english to latin google translate all day and I can tell you without looking it up that Bonorum means good and Malorum means bad.  Bonorum is probably like benevolent and malorum is like malevolent.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    Millions of programmers probably use lorem all the time and very few of them probably even realize what it means.  It means nothing, to them.  However, nothing in this reality is by mistake.  I actually went and read the sections by Cicero and realized what the theme was.  It was about the pursuit of pleasure and avoidance of pain, and it was before Christ.  This beast system killed Christ, let's not forget.  They clearly value this sophisicated pursuit of pleasure and avoidance of pain.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    What's so bad about the pursuit of pleasure and avoidance of pain?  Well, how about the fact that doing those two things is focusing on this realm.  When Jesus came, he started speaking about the kingdom of heaven.  He said things like, where your treasure is, your heart will be also. (Matthew 6:21). I think the worshippers of this realm, who value pain and pleasure above all else, killed Jesus because he was contradicting their way of life.  To someone like Jesus, both pain and pleasure are the same.  They are an attachment to this realm, ruled by Satan.  Satan doesn't care if you are experiencing pleasure or pain as long as you remain focused on this and fail to see the bigger picture, or the game.  
                </p>
                <img src="static/img/nwo.jpg" alt="New World Order" class="pic8">
                <p>
                    I'm sure it's just a coincidence the fake text used for everything is about "The Extremes of Good and Evil".  Ya, and the latin on the back of the dollar bill is just a coincidence too, right?  We've all been told that Latin is a dead language.  To me, that means it's alive and well.  Otherwise, what is it doing on the frickin dollar bill?  Every single thing, has a purpose.  It's a grand deception.  Lex Luther said "Some people can read the ingredients of a chewing gum rapper and discover the secrets to the universe, others can read War and Peace and come away thinking it was just a simple adventure story."  Just by examining what dummy text really means, I can learn so much.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I contend that the pursuit of pleasure and the avoidance of pain was the highest value of the ruling structure of the world when Jesus came.  Jesus challenged that, and they killed him, and they are still in control today.  They don't want any part of this jesus business.  Lorem Ipsum could have just has easily been a bible verse and words that Jesus himself spoke but no, of course it's the philosophy that killed him.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    There are no mistakes here.  It's supernatural.  That's why an awake person can look at almost anything and tell you the secrets of the universe, while another person is completely blind to even something as illuminating as this blog, for example.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    What else have we been told that isn't true?  What other simple questions can we ask that lead to profound knowledge?  I know it's a bit of a stretch to say that just because lorem is from a philosopher who talked about good and evil that it's put there on purpose by the same forces that killed Jesus to pay homage.  I realize that.  But if I'm constantly stretching my mind, and you're reluctant to do so, then who can touch their toes?  Stretching is good for your body so why not your mind?
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm going to give you some examples of things that if you look at with an open mind you can notice things you otherwise wouldn't be able to.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you look at big company's logos, you can really see this phenomenon in action.  Let's start with Amazon.  
                </p>
                <div class="company2">
                    <img src="static/img/amazon.png" alt="amazon" class="logo">
                    <h3>Amazon</h3>
                </div>
                <p>Do you notice any extra meaning within the logo?  </p>
                <p>
                    The arrow is going from a to z, hinting that they have everything.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    I wonder what percentage of their customers have their brains turned on enough to even notice something like that consciously. 
                </p>
                <p>That's not an important one, but I'm sure you could learn a lot just by thinking about the word "amazon" and the smiley face, and the a to z.  There's a lot to examine, but let's continue.</p>
                <div class="company2">
                    <img src="static/img/netflix.jpeg" alt="netflix" class="logo">
                    <h3>Netflix</h3>
                </div>
                <p>
                    This one to me looks like a red carpet.  Again, not important, but how many people would consciously make that connection?  How many would just see an N? Let's pick a more significant one.
                </p>
                <br>
                <br>
                <div class="company">
                    <img src="static/img/starbucks.png" alt="Starbucks" class="logo2">
                    <h3>Starbucks</h3>
                </div>
                <p>
                    I can't believe this is the real logo.  I thought it was a parody.  I knew Starbucks was going to be weird but wow.  This is some sort of goddess lifting up her legs and offering her vagina to you.  I don't know how else to explain it.  She's probably a specific diety like Lilith but I don't feel like exploring it further.  Here is the progression of the logo
                </p>
                <img src="static/img/progression.jpeg" alt="progression" class="logo">
                <p>Okay, last one</p>

                    <img src="static/img/apple.jpg" alt="Apple" class="logo">
                    <h3>Apple</h3>
                </div>
                <p>
                    Everyone knows this logo.  I just picked a cool looking version of it from google images.  But what does the iconic logo really mean?  Is it about fruit?  Is this a fruit company?  No??  Then why apples?  Maybe, just maybe, it has to do with the Garden of Eden, when Eve took a bite of the apple after the serpent told her too, and God has told her not to.  Then she had the knowledge of good and evil.  Interesting how we started out with Lorem Ipsum being about good and evil hiding in plain sight, and now you have the image of good and evil hiding on the back of your laptop right now.  
                </p>
                <p>Here's what google says, "The Apple logo was designed in 1977 by Rob Janoff. In an interview with Creative Bits he says: “I had the bite out of the apple put into the design to make it clear that it was an apple and not a cherry or a tomato. ... The rainbow colours of the original logo was the decision of Steve Jobs."</p>
                <p>
                    What an absolute joke.  It's bitten so people won't think it's a cherry or tomato?  You know we can bite those too, right?  Rob is a liar.  It's bitten because it's a reference to Eve and the knowledge of good an evil.  I don't care what they say.  The most famous bite of apple was in the Garden of Eden, and that's what an apple with a bite of it represents.  
                </p>

                <p>This post is for my friend who we'll call Scarlett so she can remain anonymous.</p>
                <p>
                    I asked her, "Do you think there is anything more to this life? Do you believe in God?"

                <p>
                    "No, but I want to believe there is something more to this life, otherwise what is the point?" She replied.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In this post, I will try to give Scarlett an introduction into answering this question for herself.  This post will be geared toward her specific background and beliefs, but could be applicable to you as well if you would answer the question in a similar way.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Scarlett has a jewish background.  However, since Judaism hasn't been satisfactory to her so far, and I know less about it than Christianity, I will be focusing this post on Christian principles as well as atheistic princles because those are the two I have the most experience with.

                <h3>3 levels of understanding</h3>
                <p>
                    One of the first books I chose to read was The God Delusion by Richard Dawkins.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    I have always been interested in the subject of God.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Dawkins is a famous athiest author, and Friedrich Nietzche is a famous athiest philosopher.  Nietzche has some of the strongest criticisms of Christianity in my opinion and I will mention those later.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Ultimately I think there are 3 basic levels of understanding God.  The first level of understanding is being raised with a religion.  Then you believe that religion before you have developed critical thinking skills and it is difficult to get out of. Some people with this level of understanding break out of it when their questions are not adequately answered within the structure of that organized religion.  Then they move onto level 2.  Others are not raised with religion and are free to make up their own mind.  These types of people will typically examine group 1 and realize it is a step below, and choose to stay where they are.  After all, group 1 cannot satisfactorily answer group 2's questions.  Group 2 would typically be able to win a debate with someone from Group 1 who has a blind belief in their rigid structure of organized religion.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Level 3 is the people in group 2 who realize there is some good things hidden in group 1 that are worth investigating and incorporating into their own belief system.  Group 3 is able to pick up something like the Bible and distinguish the truths from the lies based on their own personal experience and knowledge base.  Level 3 people are comfortable with other people mixing them up with group 1 and thinking less of them intellectually, because they understand the nuance of beliefs can be lost on some.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I believe that the teachings and parables of Jesus Christ have value.  I believe they have so much truth and value in them that people who are exposed to them are naturally drawn to them.  I also believe the teachings of this man were stolen, and religions were organized to ultimately discredit him.  For example, imagine all of the brilliant people in group 2 who do not give Jesus a chance because of the lack of critical thinking they see within group 1.  Jesus said, "And do not call anyone on earth 'father,' for you have one Father, and he is in heaven." (Matthew 23:9) and yet Catholic priests expect you to call them Father.  It's more complicated than that but I think it's a good example that there is a difference between the teachings of Jesus, and the religions of today that use him.  Consider also the abuse of children the catholic church is known for.

                </p>
                <p>
                    First of all, I have studied the mechanisms of cancer extensively,  I've written college essays in honors biology courses, but my ideas come from Jonathan Adampants' audiotape "The Healing Begins Now" I've already posted him in my blog titled "Genius or a Prophet".

                <p>
                    Second of all, pre-determinism is not true in my opinion.  In college philosphy, pre-determinism was pushed as a defensible position, but the truth is it makes little sense and our entire legal system is based upon free will.  It's why you get mad at someone if they steal your wallet.  Your anger comes from your belief that they had a choice and chose to steal.  We are hard-wired to believe in free will.  I will try to get into the mass deception that's going on but let's just say modern education loves to make you feel insignificant.  There is an agenda to prevent you from knowing who you really are, and why you're here.  You are not here by accident because of a big bang that came from nothing in particular.  You are here for a reason and are the result of a conscious decision from the creator of everything, God.  Most of this life is a deception designed to prevent you from realizing that.  If you are empowered and believe in free will and that you can change your destiny, then you can understand why bad things can happen to good people.  It's because of free will.  And I must say, if we do live forever, and God takes care of those cancer kids everafter, this life would be like dust in the wind.  If you are conned into believing this life is all there is, then it seems terribly unfair of God.  But when evaluating how fair life is I think it's important to consider how short this life is compared to eternity which is a possibility.

                <h3>Mass Deception</h3>
                <p>
                    What opened up my mind into the possiblity of Jesus is that I started noticing the tricks of the Devil.  They say the greatest trick the devil ever pulled was convincing the world he never existed.  I know, beyond a shadow of a doubt, that this earthly realm we are currently in is heavily influenced by dark forces.  The Bible says, "For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places."(Ephesians 6:12).  How do I know this?  Well, I don't know how exactly they pull off the deception, but I do know there are some lies that are so prevelant it is basically supernatural.  For example, conspiracy theories arise when people think an event was staged, or that the official story was bogus.  I have researched many conspiracy theories and although I cannot tell you exactly what actaully happened instead of the official story, I can confidently poke logical holes in the official story.  Pick your favorite conspiracy theory and I will show you its merit by poking holes in the official story.  Conspiracy theorists go awry when they try to explain how it actually happened.  They don't know.  They can only theorize.  Think of me today as an Official Story Denier, rather than a conspiracy theorist.  I'm not going to tell you how the devil does his tricks, I'm just going to point out the logical fallacies within the accepted narrative and say that's enough to prove there is a mass deception.
                </p>
                <h2>9/11 Official Narrative</h2>
                <h3>1. The black boxes (designed to be indestructible) on the hijacked plane were destroyed, but a passport and bandana of one of the hijackers survived the explosion </h3>
                <h3>2. One of the hijacked planes flew into the Pentagon.  The most secure building in the entire known universe was only able to capture 2 still images of the plane coming in, and was powerless to stop it </h3>
                <h3>3. Our Airforce was unable to shoot down the hijacked planes in time, because they were busy being confused by a hijacking training mission scheduled for that morning.  "Operation Northern Vigilance, was a NORAD operation which involved deploying fighter aircraft to locations in Alaska and Northern Canada. In order to simulate a hijacking situation including terrorist pilots." is straight from wikipedia</h3>
                <h3>4.President George Bush was notified, "America is Under Attack" by someone while he was reading a story to children in a school, and rather than evacuating or handling anything important, he stayed until storytime was over.  The kids were learning how to spell "Jet" and "Steel" that day as well.</h3>
                <h3>5. Building 7, which was not even hit by a plane, collapsed at near freefall speed due to fire from debree of the twin towers.  The Twin towers sustained the collisions of the jets, but then because of fire, suddenly collapsed into themselves at near freefall speed becoming pulverized into fine dust.   </h3>
                <p>
                    I could honestly make that list go to 100, and I could do that for any conspiracy theory.  The only way to collapse a building into itself is to basically pull the foundation out from under it.  You cannot just have a skyscraper fall that fast with that much resistance below. If it's 100 stories, and the top 5 collapses on the 6th, this does not cause a chain reaction that brings it down that quickly.  To bring it down that quickly, you need a chain reaction of explosives.  You need a controlled demolition.  Again I could go on for days, but I don't want to get into the nitty gritty unless you're interested.  There is something called the No Plane Theory, which is a theory that it was only bombs and the videos of planes were faked.  But again, that's a theory and I'm not here for theories I'm just here to make a point that the official story has so many holes that this proves this mass deception I'm talking about.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "And the great dragon was cast out, that old serpent, called the Devil, and Satan, which deceiveth the whole world: he was cast out into the earth, and his angels were cast out with him."(Revelation 12:9).  The bible says the devil deceives the whole world.  And given that I've just shown the whole world was decieved, I think the Devil was involved and I think Level 3 Christianity does the best job at explaining the mass deception we are under.
                </p>
                <h3>
                    So let's say you're with me so far.  Jesus is real, but no organized religion is correct.  The Devil controls this realm, all of education, media, and religion.  The Devil has tricked the entire world.  
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Now you have to use your inner-knowing to reexamine everything you've been told.  You need to put your armour on whenever you view anything in the media, because it is a deliberate deception. "Put on the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil."(Ephesians 6:11).

                <h2>Nietzsche's critique on Christianity</h2>
                <img src="static/img/beyond.jpeg" alt="beyond" class="pic100">
                <p>
                    Nietzsche's most famous book is called "Beyond Good and Evil".  It is a brilliant book about values.  He suggests that values have been inverted, and that Christianity uses inverted values to rule over the masses.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    For example, imagine a group of cavemen a long time ago.  One caveman is bigger and stronger than the others.  He calls himself "Good", the way you'd think of someone who is "Good" at the game of Basketball.  This big strong man calls the weaker cavemen "Bad" because they cannot do things as well as he can.  That is the original values of "Good" and "Bad".  However, after many years of the "Bad" basketball players being ruled by the "Good" ones.  They came up with their own value system.  Nietzsche argues that everyone has a will to power, and if you cannot overpower the good basketball player, as a weaker one, your will to power will manifest in other ways.  In this instance with the cavemen, the weaker players started to call themselves "Good" and the stronger players "Bad" or "Evil".  "I would never take advantage of the weak if I was that strong" is what the weak player tells himself so that he can invert the values and see himself as "Good" and his master as "Bad" or "Evil".  This is what Nietzsche calls a "Slave Morality" as opposed to a "Master Morality" which is the morality of the original big strong cavemen who just takes what he wants and assigns values as he pleases. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Christianity, is the ultimate slave morality, because it allows the oppressed to view themselves as morally superior.  Although they get nothing in their life as a slave farmer for example, they are promised rewards in heaven.  They view weakness, meekness, and obediance, as virtues.  They view power and force as vices.  But in Nietzsches view, this is only because they do not have the power to use their will to power so they have to get it done in this roundabout way.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    This is an absolutely brilliant critique of Christian values and I am forced to agree with him.  However, I still think the teachings of Jesus have merit ultimately.  Although the Christian church does use a slave morality to rule over many, the teachings of Jesus are seperate from that slave morality.  Jesus does in a way glorify the poor and weak, but I just think it's important to find a balance between moralities to make sure you aren't lying to yourself about your will to power.  I think it's important to be powerful outwardly, but also to respect the poor.  Don't be a doormat, but also don't hate your enemies.  It's a balance.  See the media will often depict light vs. dark like in star wars for example.  But the truth is you have to use both.  You have to sustain yourself and the system.  If you only give, and take nothing for yourself, you have failed the system because you are a part of the system.  So take care of yourself and the system.  Be powerful, but also meek.  Be strong, but humble.  That's my take on it.
                </p>
                <h3>The Teachings of Christ</h3>
                <p>
                    "I am the vine, ye are the branches: He that abideth in me, and I in him, the same bringeth forth much fruit: for without me ye can do nothing."(John 15:5).
                </p>
                <p>
                    I think the best metaphor for Christ vs. the Bible that I've found is Jonathan Adampants talking about riding a bike vs. reading a book about riding a bike.  "He was a bike rider, and they're trying to get you to ride him."  "They've [Priests] only read a book about riding a bike, and a fraudulent one at that, and they've never ridden a bike themselves."  "You're natually a bike rider.  Put the book down."
                    Are some of the quotes he makes in his lecture I have posted before but I will post again because it's the best.  It's Level 3 of Understanding.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    God is real.  He created you.  You have free will.  Will you choose to try to learn about him or will you choose to keep living your life without him?

                <h2>Orca Dream</h2>
                <h3>
                    03/07/2021
                </h3>
                <p>
                    I just woke up from a wonderful dream.  I was visiting a friend in Florida and he was having a party where there were many people I hadn't seen in a while.  The people were smiling at me but also avoiding me and somewhat distant except for the friend I was visiting.   There was a blonde girl who smiled but then went away who is very important to me.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The next day, still in the same dream.  I was walking down a neighborhood by a lake with 2 guy friends.  The one who I was visiting, and another great friend who didn't do much in this dream.  The one I was visiting showed me into a house where there was work on the wall.  It was similar to work that I do for insurance.  My friend was showing me this big deal that he was a part of and how the man had signed what he paid for as thousands of dollars and 14 cents like a .14 at the end.  My friend was asking my help and explaining that he wanted the change the numbers in the .14 so he didn't have to bother the very important client and ask him to pay for it again.  He asked if there was a way to replace the numbers.  It was like a computer screen on a wall.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I was hesitant to help as I didn't want to forge the man's signature or do anything unethical.  But it was only 14 cents and I knew how to do it. I told my friend he could take a screen shot of one of the other numbers he had written on the document, and then paste that onto the 14 cents to get whatever number he wanted.  I trusted my friend to not do anything bad, but to only use it when it made sense.   It was like altering 14 cents on the purchase of a yacht so as not to bother the customer.
                </p>
                <p>
                    He was very thankful, and then we walked outside down toward the lake.  Then as we were walking he pleaded with me that I only told him about how to fix his problem, but I didn't show him or actually fix it.  So I agreed to turn back and we went back to the house and to the computer wall.  It was like a whiteboard you could use a computer on.  Now I manually showed him the .14 could convincingly become whatever he wanted.  He asked me to get it to say $1 down.  He said there needed to be a down payment.  I hesitated again but it was only $1 and I wanted to help my friend so I did it.  Then we went to the lake.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    On the way, my friend was discussing how he bought a jetski.  It was expensive, and he was questioning his decision, but said when you live here it makes sense.  The Lake was magnificient.  There was a gigantic bridge in the middle of the lake that had boats underneath it.  One of the bridge boats started to drive away and now the bridge has a missing link and couldn't be used.  I was shocked!  My friend was not.  The bridge boats looked like they were multipurpose, like they could all work together and make a bridge whereever they wanted.  Also, the bridges were made out of boats and jet skis above them.  It was like the way you see a 18 wheeler carrying a bunch of cars on the highway but for boats.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    As we walk down towards the docks, it's now Me, my friend I'm visiting, and a couple of pretty girls.  One of the girls was a pretty blonde girl and she was not the same blonde from the night before.  This was one I hadn't met before.  Oddly enough, she was complaining about the $1 down payment she needed for a big deal she was working on.  My friend got on his jetski and went out into the lake.  We were on a dock in the middle of the lake somehow, surrounded by water on all sides and the dock was barely above water.  It was like walking on water.  So my friend jetskis away and I'm left with the two girls, one blonde.  Before my friend left The blonde girl is saying how she needs the down payment and I said maybe he could venmo you.  Everyone said loudly, "It's already on the water".  In this business these people were in, they needed to lie about having already received a down payment so as not to bother their customer with the details.  It wasn't that unethical, but more of a perdicament I was offering suggestions for.  They were navigating the legality of their business and it was not sinister.

                <img class="pic8" src="static/img/orca.png" alt="orca">
                <p>
                    My friend jetskis away with a smile and I am left with basically just that blonde.  I walk with her to the edge of the dock and we notice the lake is brimming with life.  There were suddenly many orcas of all sizes swimming around us.  There was 10 at once in the air.  They were behaving like dolphins but even moreso.  It felt like I was in Sea World except the orcas were completely free.  The lake was their home and they loved people.  They were putting on a show for me.  They were so magnificient.  I wasn't scared but I could sense their power and I was a little worried about falling over into the lake as they swam under us.  It was clear to me I was experiening something spectacular, even for this amazing lake.  It was something my friend would have laughed at later, the way you would laugh if you'd experienced it before.  There were so many orcas swimming around the blonde and me that it was almost dizzying, and then I woke up!

                <h3>03/06/2021</h3>
                <img class="pic8" src="static/img/hummingbird.jpg" alt="hummingbird">
                <p>
                    There is a hummingbird that hangs out by my office.  When I go to the break room, I can see him through the window hovering close to the window, almost asking me to come out and play.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I go out the door and around the corner and he buzzes around me then perches on a nearby tree.  Whenever we get close, I stop moving, so as not to frighten him. Then he jumped off the tree and flew a circle around me before landing on a higher tree farther away.  The manuever was incredibly fast and agile.  It was as if he was showing off.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I think the bird is a male because it is bright blue.  In case you don't know, male birds are often the bright ones and use it to attract females.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    When I interact with this hummingbird, it seems intelligent.  I feel like it knows things about me, that it couldn't deduce using it's small brain.  I just feel like it knows who I am.  The hummingbird is conscious, like me, and the same spirit that is animating me is also animating it.  Therefore, we are connected through the larger consciousness and somehow, the bird knows me.  I think the bird is more connected to the larger consciousness than I am, but I'm just connected enough for him to be able to pick up on that and show me his cool tricks.
                </p>
                <h2>If God was real, how could you best learn about him?</h2>
                <p>
                    Is God Real?  Talk about Occam's razor.  To remove God from the equation and try to explain the creation of the universe is much more daunting.  If God is real, then has he ever made himself known or tried to contact us?  If so, was it with Jesus Christ?
                </p>
                <p>
                    The fascinating thing about Jesus is his words are the closest thing we have to learning about God. Assuming God is real, is there a better way to get to know him than potentially his only son?  Even the Mormon's prefer Jesus to Joseph Smith, right?  Do Muslim's prefer Muhammad to Jesus?  I just read about it and apparently they think Jesus was not divine.  They think he was the messiah and born of a virgin but they deny his death on the cross.  It's interesting.  They believe in the second coming.  They just think Muhammad came after Jesus and was the final word of God.  Okay, so your top two options are Jesus and Muhammad so far to learn about God.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If God is not real, then who would your best teacher be, and what would you even be learning about?  Would you learn from Neil Degrasse tyson about the universe?  
                </p>
                <p>
                    What's more interesting?   
                </p>
                <h3 class="left">A) Learning about your universe from other people using science by getting up to speed with how much the smartest human knows today</h3>
                <h3 class="left">B) Learning about your universe from God who created it and knows everything by deciphering the words of his only son</h3>

                <p>If you examine the best case scenario of option A and option B... well option A... becoming the smartest person alive would still leave countless questions.</p>
                <p>
                    With option B you at least have the best case scenario of having basically all your questions as answerable by God.  The smartest man alive today knows next to nothing compared to what God would know if he is real.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Here's the kicker, what if he is real, and he gave his only son to teach you the things you need to know about him, and you just blew him off?  Are you not blowing him off?  Even if God wasn't real.  The risk is monumental.  It would probably still be a good idea to read the Bible and study Jesus even if God wasn't real. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    What am I getting at?  Well, when you give Jesus a chance and actually listen to what he said, he says there is a narrow road to heaven whereas the path to destruction is wide.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Just for the sake of argument, if we assume for a moment that God is real, and Jesus is his son, then the Son of God has plainly told you that most people will not be doing the right thing.  I'm paraphrasing but he basically says if you are to get into heaven, you will be persecuted by others.  He says you will not be part of the crowd.  So my question is this.  If you're part of the crowd, and you think everything is alright in the world, then shouldn't what Jesus said trouble you?  
                </p>
                <p>In other words, if you aren't persecuted, if people don't hate you, and you aren't basically by yourself on a narrow road while everyone else walks the broad road, then shouldn't you be worried?</p>
                <p>
                    My point is that you cannot simultaneously believe in Jesus, and also go along with the world and what it's doing.  The two simply do not go together.  It's impossible to believe in Jesus, and understand what he said, and then just have a bunch of opinions that everyone else more or less agrees with.   
                </p>
                <p>You have to be hated.  Your beliefs have to be despised.  You must be persecuted for them and endure til the end, and keep the faith.  That's what Jesus said would happen.  I also think that Jesus made a lot of predictions while he was alive.  Some of them came true like when he said he would rise from the dead in 3 days.  He also said he is coming back like a thief in the night.  I think he wanted to show he could make predictions and follow through during his life, so that we have good reason to believe him about his unfullfilled predictions. </p>

                <p>
                    If all Jesus did was make unfullfilled predictions we wouldn't be waiting around for him.  It's precisely because some of his predictions have already come to pass that we trust his unfullfilled predictions will come to pass.

                <p>When people attack me for trying to understand the truth of reality, it hurts at first, but at the end, it actually feels good because it confirms what Jesus predicted.  If no one was attacking me, then Jesus would be wrong, therefore not divine.  But If what Jesus said would happen comes true, then his divinity is irrefutable. 
                </p>
                <h2>Two Roads</h2>
                <img class="pic10" src="static/img/jesus.jpeg" alt="jesus">
                <p>Imagine there are two roads for the human population.</p>
                <p>
                    One road has a sign over it that says "Jesus is Divine" and the other road has a sign over it saying "Jesus is not Divine"
                </p>
                <p>
                    If the human population went down that fork in the road and you could look at a bird's eye view you would see something very interesting happen.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If most of the people went down the "Jesus is not Divine" path, then Jesus would be proven correct, therefore all of those people would be wrong.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If most of the people went down the "Jesus is Divine" path, then Jesus would not be divine, because his prediction would have been false.
                </p>
                <p>The only way he is divine is if most people decide he is not!</p>
                
                <p>
                    The surest way to God is to make sure your beliefs are in the minority, and they are unpopular.  If you have a popular opinion on a spiritual matter, then you are doomed, essentially.  Either there is No God, or there is and you missed him, on the wide road.
                    On the narrow road, at least there's a chance God is there at the end. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The only way to get your questions answered is to make sure you're on the narrow road.  
                </p>

                <p>
                    If you go down the narrow road thinking there is a God when there actually is not, then what's the downside?  You live a wholesome life and miss out on a bunch of sin you really wanted to do?  You get persecuted for standing up for your beliefs when you could have just went along with what everyone else thinks? You give too much of your money away to charity when you should have kept it for yourself?  What is so bad about that situation?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Compare the worse case scenario of the narrow road to the worse case scenario of the wide road.  Burning in Hell or even just missing out on God and Heaven.  Major bummer.  
                </p>


                <p>In conclusion,  if most people believed in Jesus, that would disprove the words of Jesus, therefore, most people would be wrong. If only some people believe in him, then his word is true, and most people would be wrong again.  Either way most people are wrong about Jesus. 
                </p>
                <h2>Rebuttal</h2>
                <p class="rebuttal">
                    If Jesus wasn't divine, and most people think he wasn't divine, then most people would be right about thinking Jesus wasn't divine.  </p>
                    <p class="rebuttal">Narrow would be the road to insanity and broad would be the road to common sense</p>
                    <p>
                        That must be how the people on the broad road think it's happening.  But by walking that path together, they fulfill Jesus's words.  The insane people have reason to keep going down the narrow road, and the popular people have reason to turn back.
                    </p>
                    <p>Jesus may or may not be at the end of the narrow road, but he is most certainly not at the end of the Broad road. So please, call me crazy as I take my chances with the narrow road to Jesus because I love him, and you're proving us both right.</p>

                    You know what's great about this website?  I'm honest.  Even if I'm flat out wrong, I'm telling you what I truly believe.  I'm also not pretending to be objective while slamming a narrative down your throat.  I'm not virtue-signaling or pushing an agenda without admitting to it openly. This site is my subjective opinion on reality. That must be nice to read.  For example,  Dr. Simone Gold is a doctor-lawyer and the head of an organization of doctors that question and criticize how the pandemic is handled.  If you google her, it will pretend to be objective information but it will all be designed to make you hate her and discredit her and her organization.  
                </p>
                <p>The poor girl has all her videos censored on her website and I think is in jail right now for involvement in the white house riot.  Here is a <a href="https://thegoldopinion.com/blog-1/f/we-do-not-consent">blog post</a> by her.</p>
                <div class="vid">
                    <iframe width="100%" height="360" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="border: none;" src="https://www.bitchute.com/embed/9bH46xQRqjFa/"></iframe>
                </div>
                <p>This video is the reason I'm a fan of her. Notice how I couldn't use YouTube. I may not agree with everything she says but I do not think she's some crazy irrational extremist like google wants you to think.</p>
                <p>If you type her name into youtube you won't find a single video of her speaking on the front page.  The top result is a different doctor probably disagreeing with her.  She's been banned and the company google which controls your search results for facts and videos has a clear agenda to prevent you from giving her a chance to speak. </p>
                <p>Perhaps that doesn't frighten you.  I'm trying to get closer to Jesus and he said in the Bible to not call other people fools.  I am a fool to Jesus.  And if I judge others as fools the same will be done to me in heaven, or at least that's what Jesus hinted at.  </p>
                <p>
                    Google was pretty close to hiring me.  They wanted me be a part of their youtube team and design the web platform for gaming or something like youtube gaming to compete with Twitch I think.  I wanted the job and I almost got it.  And then maybe I'd be with them, and driving a nicer car and watching the world burn.  I'm not holier than thou.  If they had let me join them, I probably would have.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It's funny because youtube and google have gotten so much worse since they interviewed me in 2018.  In the past three years it's gone from far and away the best to borderline useless.  I youtube Dr Simone Gold and get zero videos of her when she has hundreds?  Nice job, youtube.  You suck.  I google a doctor lawyer and see her labeled as such "Simone Gold is an American doctor, anti-vaccine activist, author, and founder of America's Frontline Doctors, a right-wing political organization known for spreading misinformation concerning the COVID-19 pandemic."  Thanks Google.  Wikipedia's probably fucked too now.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    How about "Simone Gold is a doctor-lawyer with some alternative views on the pandemic and is the head of an organization of doctors offering alternative solutions to covid"
                </p>
                <p>
                    Which one is more objective?  And again, I'm a subjective dude, so how am I so able to out-do google in this respect?  
                </p>
                <p>
                    A subjective thing on the other side of the pendulum I could say about her is "Simone Gold is a doctor-lawyer banned from youtube for countering the covid mainstream narrative.  She is the head of an organization of doctors debunking public knowledge of Covid and exposing the lies and corruption within the medical industry using her education and experience."
                </p>
                <p>That would be too subjective for a search engine, but it's one of the 3 examples of how you could introduce someone to her, and notice how google is not giving you the objective one.</p>
                <img class="pic8" src="static/img/departed.jpg" alt="departed">
                <p>
                    Calling what she is saying "dangerous misinformation" is not objective.  Who decides what misinformation is?  Facts are in dispute.  Do you really want your goverment or big tech to be able to decide what's true?  My definition of disinformation is from the movie The Departed with Leo DiCaprio.  He is undercover and wants to find the mole in the police so he tells the police captain to tell a only certain detective unit SIU some bullshit information so he can see if it comes out on his end with the crime boss.  If he gets the information that means they've narrowed the mole down to that specific police unit.  Disinformation therefore is information that is purposefully incorrect, that can be used to track the spread of that information.  That's what Tyrion Lannister did to Pycelle when he told a bunch of different people he was planning on marrying Marcella to different grooms.  Whichever groom Cersei found out about meant that Tyrion could trace who was talking to Cercei.  I hope that makes sense to you if you've seen Game of Thrones or the Departed.  Now you understand what "Disinformation" actually is.  Okay so what's "misinformation"?  Not only that, but "dangerous misinformation"?  They have to throw in the word "dangerous" in front of it to justify trumping freedom of speech.  Just like if you read a mainstream article about Covid they have to say "deadly" in front of the word virus to get you to accept the new restrictions.  Voltaire said, "The adjective is the enemy of the noun".  Using an adjective completely distracts from the noun slipped in.  They know about these tactics and use them extremely well on your mind whether you like it or not.  That's what's happening.  
                </p>
                <p>Okay so what is misinformation?  Misinformation is infromation that is false, but not necessarily purposefully so. To disinform is to lie to someone on purpose like I said before.  To misinform is to give someone infromation that is false.  If I think the moon is made of cheese, and I tell you it is made of cheese I have misinformed you.  If I know the moon is not made of cheese, and tell you that it is, then I have disinformed you.   Okay so google is claiming that Dr Simone Gold is sharing information about covid that is false, but that she doesn't know is false.  One way to look at disinformation is as a subset of misinformation but I think it's useful to distinguish the two.  But hold on, like I said, they are making an even bolder claim.  See it wouldn't be enough to censor her if she was simply saying the moon is made of cheese and believing it.  It has to be dangerous.</p>
                <p>
                    Dangerous misinformation would have to be so dangerous to listen to that they have a moral obligation to prevent the spread of its information.  First of all, that should be insulting to your intelligence that Big Brother Google thinks they have to police what you listen to because you're too stupid to decide for yourself what makes sense.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    So on what grounds could information from a doctor-lawyer be so "dangerous" and "false" that you must be protected from it?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Let's go with it.  Let's say hypothetically that Covid-19 is extremely deadly, makes your skin fall off, and turns you into a zombie that only wants to eat brains.  Let's also say that there is a vaccine that makes you immune to it and all other treatments do not work whatsoever.  Let's also say that you are a suggestible moron incapable of listening to multiple sources of information and making up your own mind.  Furthermore, let's also assume that Dr Simone Gold is a doctor and lawyer but doesn't understand medicine or law, and is hellbent on sharing her perspective and strongly recommending not to take the vaccine if you are under the age of 50. She is pushing alternative treatments that do not work whatsoever, and she is very convincing with her attractive personality and speech skills and education and experience.  If she were uncensored, millions of people would buy her snake oil and reject the vaccine, causing millions of deaths and countless misery.
                </p>
                <img class="pic8" src="static/img/tyrion.jpg" alt="tyrion">
                <p>Okay, that would be best case scenario for Google to justify her censorship on youtube, correct?  If all those extreme cases were true in this hypothetical example, would it be justified to remove her videos from where people go to watch videos?  Maybe?  I suppose so?  But if covid is really that bad and she's really that misinformed, how could she be so convincing?  Why would anyone even listen to her at all?  Why wouldn't you just take the vaccine and prevent your skin from falling off?  Why would her medical and law degree not apply to her knowledge on the subject?  Clearly, things are not so simple.  Clearly, Google is tilting the battlefield of information to one side.</p>
                <p>
                    And here I am, tilting it 1 degree in the opposite direction, toward objectivity, with my subjective opinion.  Thank you for reading.

                <h2>Why I'm Anti Anti-Depressants</h2>
                <h3>03/02/2021</h3>
                <p>
                    Besides during a new year's eve party at a beach house, I haven't drank or done drugs in at least half a year. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Part of the reason for that is that my social life isn't what it used to be and I haven't been invited to any other parties.
                    I think it's okay to do stuff with friends on special occasions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I also support the experimentation of psychadelic drugs like acid, shrooms, and the like.
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, when it comes to the daily use of drugs I do not support them unless you are epilectic, diabetic, or suffering from some kind of disease.  Depression, in my opinion, is not a disease, it's just sold to you as one so that you feel better about taking daily drugs for it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You're told that you have a chemical imbalance in your brain preventing you from being happy.  You're told they have a nice variety of pills to make you feel better.  Awesome.
                </p>
                <p>
                    What makes you think they have it figured out?  Is it the lab coat of the doctor?  Is it because he went to medical school?  I think it would be damn near impossible to make it through medical school and become a successful psychiastrist without supporting Anti-Depressants.  
                </p>
                <img class="pic" src="static/img/anti.jpg" alt="anti">
                
                <p>
                    Just because drug companies claim they can make you happy and doctors peddle it for extra money doesn't mean they know anything.  Do you think there were cavenmen walking around thousands of years ago with chemical imbalances?  Just miserable all of the time?  Kill a big ox, and make a new tool, make love to a new woman in your cave, and still depressed because of that damn chemical imbalance?  No.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Dr. Phil even says if you're miserable that's like you're standing on asphault barefoot and it's 100 degrees and you're body is telling you to get off the road and into the shade.  If you take Anti-Depressants to reduce that signal from your body, now you're standing in the middle of the road barefoot on a 100 degree day, getting more comfortable.
                </p>
                <img class="pic6" src="static/img/maryjane.jpg" alt="maryjane">
                <p>
                    I've always known that intuitively, but I fell into the trap of marijuana.  Marijuana is an awesome plant, no doubt about it.  But relying upon it for daily use is not a good idea and I know that better than most.  I used to smoke a ton of weed every day and it is most definitely not good for you.  However, I definitely like it and recommend it for occasional use, maybe even medicinal use if you have back pain or something, idk.  Generally speaking it's not good to be high all of the time.  It tampers with intuition and causes paranoia.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    So here I am, completely sober.  I literally take zero medicine of any kind and I feel great.  I think maybe God made it so I had my experience with weed and Anti-Depressants so I could relate to other people and try to bring them into the light of truth and get off the asphault.
                </p>
                <p>
                    How did I have an experience with Anti-Depressants if I'm so against them?  Well, funny enough, when you have a mental breakdown there is only one way out.  You have to give into the system, accept all of their bullshit diagnoses, nod your head until you can escape and get your own doctor and taper off the meds.  If there was any other way, I would have found it. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    When you go crazy for a month, everyone treats you like you'll be crazy forever.  They say you're schizophrenic, or bipolar, or whatever's hot right now in med school.  It's a joke and a scam.  If you refuse any of it, they will never let you escape.  I promise.  I had to take the meds and cooperate before I could escape, both the mental institutions and the structured livings I went into after.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Finally, after about a year of going along with the retarded system of psychiatry I was able to get a part-time job and get some reduction in my medication.  I was able to move into a sober living instead of a structured living and have more freedom.  I hated my therapist, and my Dad was troubled that as much as I was cooperating I absolutely hated my therapist.  He agreed to let me see a different one and I got very lucky in finding an awesome guy.  He heard my story, and how I wanted to get off meds and go back to normal, and he rejected all my previous life-long diagnoses and diagnosed me instead with Temporary Cannabis Withdrawal Psychosis.  It's true, I had been smoking major pot every day for years before I suddenly quit cold turkey.  I also quit tobacco at the same time. I quit virtually everything.  TV, Porn, smoking, drinking, you name it.   This caused me to lose sleep which eventually caused a temporary psychosis.
                </p>
                <p>
                    He said I could taper off the meds with his doctor friend next door and that's what I did.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    I started working full-time at an internship and I was almost completely off of my meds.  The meds had caused me to have a huge appetite and I put on a ton of weight that I still haven't completely shed.  They also made me zombified and unintelligent.  I was on Depakote and Abilify.  I think at this point I was only on abilify.  Oh my god, at one point they were trying to inject me with abilify, it was terrifying.  Anyway, so I am about to taper off and I'm going as fast as I can.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Then it happened.  I'm at work, and I'm off of the meds completely, and I felt like shit.  Just emptiness.  Like the difference from 10 to 5 mg was barely noticable.  But from 5 to 0 was the biggest drop you can imagine.  Maybe I did 10 to 0 but still it was unreal how awful it felt.  I felt, for the first time in my life, suicidal.  It was the only time period of my life where I seriously considered it.  I'm very against suicide in general, but there was something about coming off of Abilify where I'm certain people have killed themselves in that exact situation.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    The reason I'm so open about these things is that I have a very high opinion of myself and I think if it can happen to me it can happen to anyone.  It felt like, I'm trying to think of the words to describe how that week felt.  It felt like I would never experience joy again.  It felt like my whole life flashed before my eyes and it was nothing but pain and sadness.  It felt like a damp unease in my mind that I could never hope to dry.  It felt like death would be better, and life just wasn't worth living. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    I asked to go home and I had a great talk with my boss Peter.  He said he understood and he knew getting off meds could be tough.  I went home and toughed it out and it was difficult, but after about a week I found myself dancing to a song or laughing at a joke and I knew I was back.
                </p>
                <p>Fucking around with these mind-altering drugs is so incredibly dangerous I truly don't believe other people who aren't as strong as me could have survived.  It even occurred to me to go back on the meds and I'm writing a 1000 word essay about how much I'm against them.  The average joe would simply go back on the meds or take their own life.  It takes a warrior.</p>
                <p>
                    I don't think these drug companies know what the fuck they're doing besides making money and having no liability.  I highly doubt they're trying to "help" people.  If today's medical system "helps" you then you'd no longer be a customer.  That's how our world works.  They have a financial incentive to make every healthy person sick because sick people are customers.  If you don't have a disease, they'll just make one up by taking something normal and making you think it's a disease, like erectile dysfunction.  I'm not an expert on that because I'm not even 30 but you get my point, oh wait I forgot, you don't!  My point is that they don't care about your health.  They want you to stay sick or stay thinking you're sick and they want you to be a lifelong customer, and they probably design those drugs to be horrible to come off of so that you keep buying them.  It's a possibility.

                <p>
                    We need water, food, clothes, shelter, family, friends, and a purpose.  If you examine you're own life and find that you "need" a shot of tequila, or you "need" a cigarette, or you "need a hit from the bong" then that means you are out of balance.  You are addicted and your motivations have twisted your mind into thinking it needs something when it actually doesn't.  I don't need anything to achieve homeostasis.  I am just in a perpetual state of peace.  I need water and food and the basics of course, but that's because everyone does.  If you're finding yourself needing something that not everyone else needs, then something is terribly wrong and you are mistaken about what you do or do not need to live.  Again, I have nothing against Insulin or Epileptic medication or some other instances but to pretend depression and anxiety are the same of those is the greatest fraud in medicine I've seen in my entire life.

                <p>
                    I realize these opinions are controversial.  As a self-proclaimed philosopher, I do not see the point in discussing what everyone already understands unless it's wrong.  If everyone and myself all agree the sky should be blue, it's not worth talking about to me.  I may appear edgy, but that's just the nature of my philosophy.  I mean you no harm.  It's your beliefs I'm threatening, not you.  Relax.

                </div>
                <p>If you google Isaiah 11:6 you will see many pictures and drawings of a lion laying down with a lamb.  These two animals are symbols of Jesus's personality as he is both Lion and Lamb.  The act of them lying together is a well known biblical symbol.   However, in this reality today, the verse has always been about a wolf laying down with a lamb.  Below I have included a verse about a wolf and what they symbolize, and then a verse in Revelation about God saying what he'll do to those who tamper with his word. </p>
                <p>
                    Matthew 7:15<br>
                     Beware of false prophets, which come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly they are ravenous wolves.

                </p>
                <p>
                    Revelation 22:18-19 ESV<br>
I warn everyone who hears the words of the prophecy of this book: if anyone adds to them, God will add to him the plagues described in this book, and if anyone takes away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God will take away his share in the tree of life and in the holy city, which are described in this book.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I apologize for getting frustrated in my "Post for No One".  All I can do is present the information to the best of my ability and hope it helps you.  The way I see it, there is overwhelming evidence the Bible has supernaturally changed from lion and the lamb to wolf and the lamb, and that means the bible might be different 10 years from now if you go to pick it up then so you should read it now if you ever want to.  I don't know for sure if the bible is the key to salvation.  I think it is a good thing to read if you know how to read it.  I think there is a mixture of truth and lies in the bible and perhaps that is blasphemous to say.  I prefer Adampants's take on Jesus and not the rigitity of the organized religious systems of Christianity.  
                </p>
                <p>I had to make that image myself (I added the quote only) because the images of lions and lambs with a verse usually are talking about a wolf inexplicably.  Why would you draw a lion and a lamb and quote a bible verse about a wolf and a lamb?  Shouldn't you draw the wolf laying with the lamb?  That's enough for me.  Please forgive me for getting frustrated.</p>

                <h2>The Philosophy of Science</h2>
                <h3>02/24/21</h3>
                <p>
                    My friend has challenged me to prove the mandela effect in a scientific way.  I'm a philosphy major, not a science major, but I did take a class on the philosophy of science. Unfortunately for me, I didn't read the books I was assigned.  However, I have a big book on my bookshelf by Karl Popper called "The Logic of Scientific Discovery" that I've been waiting until I'm mature enough to read.  I just pulled it out and opened to a random page and found the perfect quote:
                </p>
                    <p>
                    "With the idol of certainty (including that of degrees of imperfect certainty or probability) there falls one of the defences of obscurantism which bar the way of scientific advance.  For the worship of this idol hampers not only the boldness of our questions, but also the rigour and the integrity of our tests. The wrong view of science betrays itself in the craving to be right; for it is not his possession of knowledge, of irrefutable truth, that makes the man of science, but his persistant and recklessly critical quest for truth."(p281).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        My interpretation of that quote is that true science is not limited by certainty.  So if my friend wants a shallow understanding of something as complicated as the Mandela Effect then I cannot oblige.  Karl Popper is saying that the traditional view of science as only what can be irrefutably proven is the wrong view and actually limits the questions we ask and restricts us from reaching the truth.  That is why I say that view of science is shallow.  It's narrow.  It's vain.  It's unhelpful.  The real man of science is someone who is persistant in his quest for truth.  Dare I say, a truther?  I actually like the term truther and feel it describes me much better than the weaponized term of conspiracy theorist.  At my core, I'm on a quest for the truth, no matter where it takes me, no matter how foolish I may seem to others.  An insecure mind, would seek only knowledge that can be irrefutably proven to others.  I think it's time for these types of minds to wade past the shallow end of the pool of knowledge and come swim with me in the deep end.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Do you want to be right?  Or do you want the truth?  
                    </p>
                    <h3>Part 2</h3>
                    <p>
                        Now I will begin the correct type of scientific inquiry into the Mandela Effect.  Two things spring to mind.
                    </p>
                    <h4>1. Someone who doesn't belive in the Mandela Effect has to discount every single instance of the phenomenon.  In every single example of large groups of people sharing false memories, the only explanation is that they are confabulating or misremembering in 100% of occurances.</h4>
                    <h4>2. Every single piece of "residue" or hard evidence of the false memory being real must be discounted as fake or a typo if it is a printed misspelling of someone's name.</h4>

                    <p>
                        Another thing that springs to mind is the non-believer of the mandela effect must also discount his own memories!  For example, I asked him where the Statue of Liberty is.  He said Ellis Island as did another person listening.  No one said what is now considered by Google to be the correct answer,  "Liberty Island."  
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The psychology of the nonbeliever is interesting because in that Statue of Liberty example they have 2 choices.  
                    </p>
                    <h4>1. Discount their personal memory as false and try to "take the download" of the new fact of Liberty Island.</h4>
                    <h4>2. Reexamine and potentially remodel their model of reality.</h4>
                    <p>The nonbeliever chooses to discount their own memory rather than reality itself.</p>
                    <p>That is perfectly understandabe.  However, how far would you let it go?  Suppose there were suddenly 364 days in a year and everyone acted like it was always that way.  Would you go with option 2 then?  In other words, would that be too far or not enough?</p>
                    <p>For me, I know how to spell.  I know how to spell dilemna.  Suddenly it's supposed to be dilemma and sorry but that's a dealbreaker for me.</p>
                    <p>
                    With the statue of Liberty Example, there are pictures of people on Ellis Island posing next to what they think is the Statue of Liberty only in the picture they are posing next to nothing at all because it isn't there.  That's not irrefutable proof but it is staring at you in the face.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        My favorite example of this is the Thinker.  The Thinker is a statue of a man with his fist on his forehead while he is in deep thought.  However, if you google it he is resting his chin on his hand.  
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        There's a picture of a woman next to the statue posing in a similar fashion.  You would think the pose would match but she has her fist on her forehead whereas the statue in the picture has his chin on his hand. 
                    </p>
                    <div class="pic3">
                        <img class="pic3" src="static/img/thinker.jpeg" alt="thinker">
                    </div>
                    <p>The infadel would have to conclude she is just stupid because there's no way the statue could have changed, she must just be posing incorrectly.</p>
                    <p>
                        Aristotle said, "It's the mark of an educated mind to be able to entertain a thought without accepting it." and I think that's necessary here.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Other types of hard evidence would be "Interview with a Vampire" or "Sex in the City" being printed in magazines or spoken by the people who made them.  You would think the person who wrote or starred in something would get the title correct, wouldn't you?  But people cling to their reality so desperately they probalby don't even look into the hard evidence because of what Aristotle said.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        So providing evidence is useless in this instance if you're incapable of entertaining the thought.  Did the monopoly man have a monacle?  Did Curious George have a tail?  Did pikachu have a black part of his tail?  Was Chick-Fil-A ever spelled Chic-fil-a or some other way?  Did Darth Vader say, "Luke, I am your father"?  Did Hannibal Lector ever say, "Hello Clarice".  If you build it, who will come?  
                    </p>
                    <h3>Part 3</h3>
                    <h4>If even one example of the mandela effect is true then the entire accepted model of reality breaks down because this reality's past is not the same as your past.  </h4>
                    <p>
                        I can't do it for you.  You have to decide for yourself that your memory is more than something to be discarded.  Perhaps it is to be cherished as sacred rather than discarded as trash.  Maybe you are more than this reality.  Maybe you aren't.  Not everyone is Mandela Effected.  Some people who believe in the effect have certain memories that contradict an accepted mandela effect within the truth community.  I don't have all the answers.  But I do ask the reckless questions.  And Karl Popper and Aristotle are on my side, in the deep end, where the answers lie beneath murky water.
                    </p>

                <h2>How Hollywood Portrays Human Nature, and How Actors who are known for something else are Frauds.</h2>
                <h3>2/20/21</h3>
                
                <p>1.) I think that the way people behave in the Movie Greenland is unrealistic.  For Example, in Greenland, this guy is giving Gerald Butler's wife and kid a ride, but of course he has to be evil so he violently throws her out of the car and kidnaps the kid.  I turned it off after that because there's no logical reason for it. Stealing both their bracelets and throwing them both out would make some sense.  I guess he wanted a kid?  Whatever.  I think that people are good and not willing to throw away their humanity and decency just for a shot at getting into a shelter from an asteroid.  I could be wrong.  I just think that Hollywood purposefully makes it so these people are acting like savages to give us the illusion that we'd descend into madness without government.  For example, in another dumb scene people are looting a Rite aid and the wife and kid are looking for insulin when suddenly a bunch of guys with guns come in and start shooting people.  First of all, there's no reason to shoot anyone because they don't have guns and are trying to escape.  I guess you could shoot one person in the leg and claim the store for your group if you want to post up but they literally shoot an old lady for no reason and kill her.  Then the wife is trying to hide and a black guy with a shotgun sees her.  She begs for her life, and he acts like it's a hard decision to make and then offers his hand to help her up, and then tells her to get out of here.  It's all very bizarre like as if he thought he was supposed to shoot a woman and child in cold blood... for what?  It's just ridiculous.  </p>
                <p>
                    In another scene the people break through the airport to try to get on a plane and then the miltary just open fires on people and they fire back and it's like again just kind of frantic and bizarre and overdone.  I get that people want to stay alive but there's more to this life than that.  I wouldn't shoot civililians if I was a soldier and I wouldn't shoot a soldier if I was a civililian. I don't know.  I get that it's a movie I just think they're pushing on us the idea that we'd rip each other apart without our current system but I don't think that's as true as they portray.  I also don't think they're doing it to make a better movie.  I am suggesting they do this on purpose.
                </p>
                <p>
                    2.)  The other thing I want to discuss is Bill Nye the Science Guy making an appearance in the Movie Bliss.  First of all the movie Bliss is a can of worms in it of itself which I think also depicts human nature in a purposefully bad light.  But we're moving on to the second topic of discussion which is Hollywood actors who are known for not acting.  For example, Bill Nye the science guy is known for educating kids about science in a fun way on his show.  That's all fine and good except then he suddenly has a decent role in a movie.  This makes him a serious actor and he has serious acting skills.  So, when you watch him talking about science on his show as himself, or even in an interview, and then you see him acting as a character in a movie, what's the difference?  How do you know he's telling the truth about science when he's a professsional actor.  Now, in Bill Nye's case this isn't very important but I bring him up because he died once and I stayed up all night reading every quote he had on brainy quote.  I basically donated a night of my life in honor of his death and I learned about him and appreciated him for teaching and thought it was too bad he left this world.  Then suddenly he's alive again in this reality and never died and I don't even know if there was a false report of his death or not in this reality but I thought he was dead.  Now he's alive and well apparently.  Whatever, he gives me the creeps now.  It's like he was resurrected.  The reason I bring this actor/scientist thing up is it happens in a much more significant way with Wolf Blitzer of CNN's the situation room.  Wolf Blitzer is the go to guy to cover an event like Sandy Hook's shooting.  Everyone grabs their tissues to cry and hangs on every word out of Wolf's mouth. But then, at the same time, he's appeared in mission impossible movies as an actor giving fake news reports of events that never happened. Trust me, I get that it's theoretically possible that he's an honest newsman on CNN, but then is offered a role in hollywood and says yes and gives a fake news broadcast.   But that should bother you.  Because what that's saying is that it is well within Wolf Blitzer's toolbox to say whatever he's paid to say regardless of its truth!  He clearly has no problem going in front of a camera and spewing bullshit and pretending it's news in mission impossible so is that not a little bit unsettling that he looks identical whether he's acting or reading the news?  What's to stop someone from paying him to tell fake news?  His morals?  Do you know the guy?  He's officially an actor!  I mean the director of mission impossible chose Wolf for his acting skills, idk.  It's just ridiculous if you really think about it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In my opinion, Bill Nye is a fraud.  Wolf Blitzer is a liar.  They are both professional actors not some of the time they're on camera, but 100% of the time.  I also think that were an asteroid headed for Earth to kill most of us we wouldn't immediately start shooting old ladies and kidnapping other people's children.  I think there would be some chaos for sure, but there would still be some good people doing good deeds.  And sorry, Greenland, not shooting a woman and child for no reason doesn't count as a good deed.

                <h2>Schrodinger's Covid</h2>
                <h3>02/19/21</h3>
                <p>
                    Schrodinger's Cat is a thought experiment where there's a cat in a box with a radioactive substance that may or may not kill him.  Please look it up if you've never heard of it or you will no have no chance understanding what I'm about to say.  Basically he argues the cat is both alive and dead at the same time, and only when you open the box does the cat become one or the other.  This agrees with the narrow slit experiment where waves become particles only when observed.  If you haven't heard of these experiments then please go learn quantum physics 101 before coming back here because this is Advanced Quantum Theory.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So I have a friend who wishes to remain anonymous.  We share the same world view although it is uncommon.  I wanted to do a podcast with him and call it "The Boys Who Cried Wolf" because I want to give him a chance to get his theory of reality out there because it's very intriguing.  He has Covid and cannot do the podcast and doesn't like writing it out so I will just do my best and he can correct me later on the podcast.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    His working theory is that reality is a matrix of possibilities and everything has already happened in a higher dimension where God's watching.  However, in our dimension, we are making choices that affect the reality we experience.  So it's like a choose your own adventure story, where God is the author and we are the reader.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now I'm going to try to apply his theory on a macro level and reconsile it with quantum physics and give a concrete example of how it might work.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Let me start with an example of the quantum reality.  The last time I spoke to my dad was earlier today.  There are a few different versions of him since then that are possible.  Right now, to me, he's like a wave of possibilities of different decisions he could have made since we spoke.  If I call him on the phone right now and ask him how his day went then that wave becomes particles.  Then I can actually pinpoint dates, times, and what he did.  But before I open the box, the cat is both dead and alive.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    Okay, so back to my anonymous friend.  He and I talk often.  He didn't tell me he had covid.  I learned from our third friend when I called him about his dog.  Now the third friend doesn't agree with me and my anonymous friend.  His worldview is different.  So what if, when I called the third friend, I interacted with his reality, which is different from my own.  And our realities merged.  So to my third friend, my anonymous friend has covid because it serves him right for being an anti-masker.  The poetic justice makes sense in his universe.  Anyway, by me calling him and him telling me that information about my anonymous friend, I then have merged with that universe and called my anonymous friend and sure enough he had covid.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If I had never made the call, and never found out from the third friend, then my anonymous friend would be a wave, maybe he has it, maybe he doesn't, but the wave would lean towards him not having it according to my world view.  But by exposing myself to a contrary universe I brought that into my own and the wave was forced to become a certain particle.  
                </p>
                <p>None of this will make any sense if you don't accept the idea that there are parallel universes overlapping all of the time in the way I'm describing.  Obviously, if there is only one physical universe then this doesn't make any sense.  However, if the cat is truly alive and dead at the same time, and the particle is truly a wave when you're not observing it, which it is, then this theory makes senes.  </p>
                <p>
                    If I haven't heard about a fourth friend in years, a larger wave of possibilities exists in my reality.  But when I speak to them I pinpoint it down to a particle.  But maybe the wave is just as true as the particle.  And whatever particle I eventually pin down is a reflection of my choices, who I talk to, etc.  
                </p>
                <p class="profound">
                    There are waves of possibilities that are just as real as the actual particulates of events that we discover.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our realities are not the same.  We can briefly share one by merging upon interaction, and then we break off again into separate realities.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Mandela effect could be the result of a merge conflict of the shared realities of people on the internet.  Many realities collided together on the internet and a new reality emerged which had to decide how to spell dilemna.  This reality went with Dilemma to upset the least amount of people in this reality bubble.  However, some people who came here from the dilemna reality feel left out and that's what the mandela effect is.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    I believe someone in this reality when they say it has always been dilemma for them and they are a good speller.  I also believe my own spelling of dilemna.  What if both were true but then our realities collided and merged and that created a merge conflict of the spelling of that word and this reality decided on dilemma.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    Reality is not stagnant.  It is alive, changing, and making decisions.  It is forming itself based on the decisions/consciousness of its inhabitants.  I don't know how many realities there are but I know that this current reality has at least 2 branches in it's history.
                </p>
                <p>Now that I think of it, the best explanation for all of this is that reality is created by consciousness.  Our thoughts are literally shaping reality into form.  Reality has been changing according to our thoughts.  Reality is designed to fit whatever thoughts we project onto it.</p>
                <p>We all have our own reality responding to our own consciousness, but it also responds to other people's consciousness.  Other people are just as real as us, but they may be tuned to a different frequency or radio station (reality station).</p>

                <p>
                    My anonymous friend likes to say when we're on the phone that we are speaking to the version of the other person that made all the decisions to lead up to that phone call, but that there are other versions as well that are equally real.  And whose to say we aren't tuned in to only one at a time?  And can we change the channel?  I think we can.  I think I have.  I think the universe I'm in now is not the universe I grew up in, and I think it's because of decisions that I made along the way.
                </p>
                <p>I get that this all seems crazy but it's an advanced quantum theory of consciousness and reality so what did you expect?</p>
                <p>And how do you know what death is?  What if when you're about to die in a horrible car crash God can pick you up and place you in a reality where you didn't die and keep watching you?</p>
                <p>How many times have you already died?</p>
                <p class="profound">
                    What if no one really dies?  What if the people who aren't you can die in your reality and still be alive in theirs?
                </p>
                <p>
                    How do you know what life, death, reality, consciousness and God are?
                </p>
                <p>How do you know?</p>

            <h2>Cocktail Party</h2>
            <h3>2/17/21</h3>
            <p>

I know how to sound smart at a cocktail party.  I know what's thought of as smart, and what's thought of as crazy.  Let's examine the underlining theme of what is accepted as intelligent, and what is rejected as crazy.  So in this exercise, I assume all of what's accepted as either true or false, and see what the effect of having these beliefs has on your subconscious mind.  
            </p>
            <h4>History of the World (Accepted)</h4>
            <p>
1.  There was a big bang and then physical matter produced consciousness<br>
2.  Evolution turned a monkey into a person and that's how you were created<br>
3. We put a man on the moon in 1969<br>
4.  911 was a terrorist attack and Osama Bin Laden was responsible<br>
5.  Everyone who shares false memories is simply misremembering and reality has always been the same.<br>
6. The Coronavirus is real and came from a bat and is so dangerous that we have to wear masks at all times, socially distance, and stay inside.<br>
7.  The vaccine is super safe.<br>
            </p>
<h4>Accepted Beliefs' Subconscious Conclusion:</h4>
<p>
    You are here by accident.  You are a advanced version of a monkey created by chance.  Man walked on the moon in 1969  but hasn't been able to do it since, despite all the technological advances in 2021 (52 years).  America is in danger of attacks from terrorists in the middle east who don't like our freedom.  The world is in danger of a deadly virus and has to wear masks at all times, avoid getting within 6 feet of another person, and should take an experimental vaccine that was developed in less than a year.  They should keep wearing the mask after getting vaccinated, and keep getting vaccinated every year.
</p>
        <h4>Translation:  You're here by accident and should be very afraid.</h4>


        <h4>History of the World (Rejected)</h4>
        <p>
1.  Consciousness came before the physical reality<br>
2.  You were created by God<br>
3.  We haven't been to the moon<br>
4. 911 was an inside job<br>
5. The Mandela Effect is evidence that reality is unstable<br>
6. The Coronavirus is fake, manmade and hardly worth fussing over<br>
7.  The vaccine is dangerous<br>
</p>
<h4>Rejected Beliefs' Subconscious Conclusion:</h4>
<p>
    You are here for a reason.  God created you and loves you.  We have not been able to walk on the moon.  Your country is not under a serious threat of terrorism.  Reality is changing somehow and many people share memories of it being different.  The Coronavirus was made to scare you but it's nothing to worry about, you can take off your mask and get close to people.  The vaccine is experimental and not necessary.
</p>

<h4>Translation :  You're here for a reason and there's nothing to fear.</h4>

<h3 class="profound">Option A (accepted by society as smart) You're here by accident and should be very afraid.</h3>
<h3 class="profound">Option B (accepted by society as crazy) You're here for a reason and there's nothing to fear.</h3>
<p>Which do you choose?</p>

Hi Max! 
<br>


Read your Cocktail Party blog...
<br>
Just thought I’d share my thoughts/views on your two lists of accepted vs rejected reality.
<br>
Your list of what is “accepted” vs “rejected” and my thoughts on it:

<br>

1. There was a big bang and then physical matter produced consciousness vs.
Consciousness came before the physical reality
<br>
What I believe: I lean heavily toward consciousness came before reality. I think more and more people (at least the ones I talk to) lean this way too. I think people are increasingly unsatisfied with the theory of the “big bang” – it just doesn’t explain how we, and all our amazing intricacies came into being. The “reality” that it’s the Big Bang that started all… this… is not universally accepted.
<br>

2. Evolution turned a monkey into a person and that's how you were created vs.
You were created by God
<br>
What I believe: I have trouble picking between these two options. I get Darwin. I get evolution. But, I have a liiiiiitle trouble buying that I evolved into me, from a monkey. I get it. Millions of years of evolution…maybe it resulted in us. Maybe. But I don’t subscribe to that as my reality.
Likewise… “I was created by God”. Ok. What exactly does that mean? That could mean God created me through evolution – monkey to man. Or, when you say “created by God” do you mean, God spoke, and suddenly, I was? How do you define “created by God”? What even is “God”. And, what does that “creation” look like? How did he do it?
<br>
I 100% believe that I am not my body. I 100% believe that I am energy. And, when I die, I won’t.
<br>
I also, 100% don’t know who created me… who created, ME. Not my physical form (thanks mom and dad), but my energy. Where did THAT come from? Not a monkey. Maybe from God… but what is God?
<br>
3. We put a man on the moon in 1969 vs. We haven't been to the moon
<br>
What I believe: I’m not sure how this is really relevant. It feels like a distraction. Does it matter one way or another if we went to the moon or not? If it does, why? Perhaps we haven’t ever been back to the moon, because we already did it. Why do it again?
<br>
4. 911 was a terrorist attack and Osama Bin Laden was responsible vs. 911 was an inside job.
<br>
What I believe: Admittedly, I don’t spend a lot (or any) time thinking about things like #3 and #4. What if 911 was a legit terrorist attack? What if it was an inside job? There are a lot of really shitty people in the world that want to cause you harm because, they’re shitty.  Those shitty people are from foreign countries, and from right here in the US. So… in that regard, 911 was the same awful event whether it was an inside job or not. Shitty people doing shitty things. Shitty things are always going happen on small and large scales, because, shitty people are out there. Everywhere.
<br>
5. Everyone who shares false memories is simply misremembering and reality has always been the same. Vs. The Mandela Effect is evidence that reality is unstable
<br>
What I believe: I believe things change, and brands get rebranded. It happens ALL THE TIME. I’ve worked in enough corporate environments to have seen it done, over and over. So, if someone remembers Jiffy vs Jiff, or Berenstein vs Berenstain? I could mean BOTH are true. And, at some point the decision was made to change the name. Now, when you talk about memories such as, did Mandela die in prison, or not… then it gets a little weirder, and maybe it is a glitch in the simulation.
I also know that memories are extremely faulty. So, is “Everyone who shares false memories simply misremembering…?” No. But some are. And, “reality has always been the same.” Reality is EXTREMELY subjective. So, it’s NEVER the same for everyone.
<br>
The Mandela Effect is a fun way to classify our sketchy memories. Maybe reality is shifting. But then again, it’s constantly shifting based on our evolving consciousness.

<br>
6. The Coronavirus is real and came from a bat and is so dangerous that we have to wear masks at all times, socially distance, and stay inside. Vs. The Coronavirus is fake, manmade and hardly worth fussing over

<br>
What I believe: Is somewhere in the middle of the two choices you’ve proposed. I don’t believe I have to wear a mask “at all times”, or stay away from people all the time, or stay inside. That’s ridiculous. But I also accept that for some people, the coronavirus is way worse than the “flu”. I’ve heard of too many accounts (through friends and family) of people (otherwise healthy) who have gotten it and either died, or are still dealing with repercussions from it. My cousin has had it twice. He’s still dealing with breathing problems, and he had it back in November. So, it’s not nothing, and I’m willing to wear a mask in crowded public places to not be a dick to someone who might be very susceptible to it. But, I’m also going to carry on with my life, and do what I think it ok for ME.

 
<br>
7. The vaccine is super safe. Vs The vaccine is dangerous

 
<br>
What I believe: I don’t believe the vaccine is “super safe”, but I’m also happy my parents are getting it, so I also don’t think it’s “dangerous”. Again, it’s not a black and white thing here.

 
<br>
Translations: You're here by accident and should be very afraid. Vs You're here for a reason and there's nothing to fear.
<br>
What I think: We’re here for a reason, and ultimately (looking at the BIG picture) there’s nothing to fear. But that doesn’t mean bad things won’t happen. That doesn’t mean you won’t be afraid sometimes. We all make up this “reality”. And each of us individually have the power to affect someone else’s reality with our actions, or inactions. “Reality” is not this, or that. It has many shades of grey. It is fluid and constantly changing. 

<br>
LOVE!
Michele

                Matt uses a great metaphor in this one.  The truth is uncovered based on the way we are attacked by this world.  They don't go only for your body. The go for your mind too.  And they go for your soul.   But you have to give it willingly.  Based upon the way all these tricks are played.  Matt asks why would they play all these tricks if they could get just get it by force or couldn't get it at all.  The sheer amount of trickery played is a dead giveaway that we have souls and we sometimes give them away.
            </p>
            <p>
                Matthew 10:28 
                And be not afraid of them that kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul: but rather fear him who is able to destroy both soul and body in hell.
            </p>
            <p>He also makes a brilliant point against hell.  Suffering for eternity based on one lifetime here on Earth would be like a teacher handing out final grades on the first day of school as the children walked into the classroom.  It's absurd.</p>

            <p>
                So do not let this reality convince you to punish yourself.  You can walk confidently out on the playground because that big scary bully can't even touch you.  All he can do is try to convince you to hurt yourself.  Those appear to be the rules to this life. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I spent a decade researching everything and I could tell you so many things it would make your head spin but no worldly facts are anywhere near as important as the lesson of the bully who can only beat you up by convincing you to do it to yourself.

                This is a perfect example of predictive programming.  Predictive programming is when Hollywood puts out new concepts that we can get comfortably acquainted with in movies before they implement it in reality.  In this movie you have Covid 23 mutating and the department of sanitation going door to door and placing people in Q zones.  That means they are planning to do those things.  It won't be as blatant as the movie but people will be more likely to accept it since they've already seen it in a movie.  This is honestly the most obvious example I've ever seen except it hasn't happened yet so I guess we'll see.

            <h3>2/13/21</h3>
            <p>My coworker tells me to look on the bright side.  My best friend tells me to stop blaming the government for my own unhappiness. In this post, I'm going to share when I was unhappy, and how that's no longer the case.  I'm going to try to explain the difference between personal unhappiness, and environmental unhappiness.
            </p>
            <p>
                I have been unhappy before.  I have sufferered daily with severe anxiety for years at a time.  I know what Hell on Earth is.  I also know what Heaven on Earth is.  Heaven was when I was in love with my highschool sweetheart, through the first year of college.  Hell is what happened shortly after I moved off campus during my sophomore year, and my girlfriend broke up with me and wouldn't visit.  
            </p>
            <p>
                I tried to get her back, but I knew I couldn't visit her at her school, and she wouldn't visit me, so I tried to get her back through writing songs, texts, and emails.  This was a hopeless endeavor. By focusing on how I appeared through digital long distance, I let my physical self go.  It wasn't like I could gel my hair and knock on her door.  I let that part of myself go.  
            </p>
            <p>
                I was so sad that when I wasn't writing love songs I was trying to forget about it by playing call of duty and smoking marijuana.  I would skip class because it was too much of a shock to suddenly be on campus surrounded by hundreds of people when I had been alone in my room for so long leading up to it.  I started getting terrible anxiety from all the weed and isolation.
            </p>
            <p>
                I eventually developed Paruresis which is a condition where you have a shy bladder and can't urninate in public, except mine was so bad, I basically couldn't urinate at home if other people were there.  I was feeling very inadequate with not having a girlfriend anymore too so I was feeling very insecure and was just destroyed by Paruresis.  It got so bad it became my main reason for skipping class until I failed out of UCSC and came back home.
            </p>

                I was so embarrassed I couldn't tell anyone what I was going through.  Finally I told my Mom.  Eventaully I was telling my Dad, and my best friends.  Now, I'm telling the world.  Honestly it doesn't matter to me anymore, and the more people you tell the less serious it becomes.  I don't suffer from anxiety anymore.  I don't live in a personal hell.  In those days, I could have been at a concert at UCSC with a beautiful ocean view and beautiful girls dancing and I would have been having a terrible time and thinking about going to the bathroom.  I would go to the bathroom, lock the door, try and fail to pee, and then go back out, then try again in 5 minutes.  It was painful and horrible.  I wouldn't drink anything in public, because I didn't like having to use the restroom in public, so I was dehydrated.  That is how I define personal unhappiness. Regardless of my environment, I was unhappy.
            </p>
            <p>
                Eventually I came home, told some people, read a book about OCD called Brain Lock, and then gradually got over the problem.  I went to Moorpark College to get good grades to get back into UCSC.  I eventually overcame my anxiety and graduated from UCSC with a cute girlfriend. 
                My personal Hell was over, and has been over since.  I know the tricks of how to deal with anxiety or depression (without meds) and my personal hell is so far away it's hard to believe that was the same person. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Now, I want to talk about environmental hell.  In Man's Search for Meaning, Victor Frankl tells a story of his experience in a concentration camp.  I'm not in one of those, but my point is that he had his mind right, but he was in environmental hell.  No one would blame Victor Frankl for saying something negative about his environment.  They wouldn't claim he was blaming the Nazi's for his own personal hell.  It really was hell closing in on him, and he would have to be blind not to see it and be bothered by it.
            </p>
            <p>
                So what kind of environmental hell am I claiming to be in?  Well, how about America today?  Let me explain, because it's very nuanced.  I'm not talking about America today for the average person.  No, the average person is completely oblivous to what I'm going through.
            </p>
            <p>
                So what am I going through?  Well first, let me tell you the story of Ignaz Semmelweis.  This man set out to solve the problem of babies and mothers dying at an alarming rate.
            </p>
            <p>
                Eventually he figured out, and proved to himself, that doctors were touching dead bodies and then delivering babies without washing their hands in between.  He didn't know the exact mechanism of the germs but he knew washing hands before delivering the babies would dramatically reduce the death rates of mothers and their newborn children.  
            </p>
            <p>
                At the time, doctors laughed at him and his theories, because there was no publicly accepted theory of germs at the time.
            </p>
            <p>
                This put Ignaz Semmelweis into an environmental hell.  It wasn't a personal hell.  He would be fine if they listened to him and the babies were saved.  It was an environmental hell because he was unable to convince anyone, or save any babies.
            </p>
            <p> This drove him insane.  He called the doctors, "Murderers" and ended up in a mental institution.</p>
            <p>History has proven him right, but his environment never did.</p>

            <p>
                What I'm going through, my personal struggle, is virtually identical to that.  My balance, is how do I accomplish what I wish to accomplish without going insane?  That is my dance.  That is my greatest challenge. 
            </p>
            <p>
                So what do I know that you don't?  Who is dying?  How can I save them?  What do I want to convince you of so badly that's it's already literally driven me insane??
            </p>
            <p>
                I cannot tell you.  Not only do you lack the patience, but so do I.  I'm just trying to at least establish the fact that I am in a torture chamber called America Today.  I am in environmental hell.
            </p>
            <p>I'll give you a hint.  My personal bliss is interrupted every time I see a mask.  Every time I hear people mention the vaccine, or social distancing.  It rips me apart.

                Matt analyzes Groundhog day and talks about Bill Murray's journey from trying to exploit his situation, to attempting suicide, to saving people.  It's such a brilliant analysis I'm just at a loss for words...  
            </p>
            <p>There's really nothing to say.  I don't want this to be a quantum video every time but when he puts out pure gold what can you do.  I figured out one other common theme between him and Adampants.  They both speak to the act of saving another life, not for a reward, but for yourself.  Like Bill Murray has the power to save the kid's life falling out of the tree, and he knows he's not going to be thanked, he believes he's trapped in this day forever, and he still helps the kid.  Adampants talks about saving someone from drowning and what the reward would be.  He has this great line, "you get to heaven and God says here is your reward, you open the box, what's in there?" The point is that saving the person is the reward; anything else is trivial.  Adampants is the only truth I've found other than the occasional parable from Jesus.  We are so lucky to have this quantum of conscience guy creating content right now. It's just such a rare perspective and it's so close to the truth I can see the magnetism in the air.</p>

                <h2>
                    People, Time, and Spreadsheets
                </h2>
                <h3>02/10/21</h3>
                <p>
                    Have you ever felt like there wasn't enough time in a day?  I've dealt with that problem a lot but now I'm making an active effort to shut out distractions and focus on what's truly important.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I decided to make a spreadsheet of all the people I care about.  I have categories of people like family, extended family, friends, girls, men, and women.  Then I have a column for phone number, for their birthday, and when they last communicated with me, what they said, and what kind of terms we're on.  
                </p>
                <p>I'm probably not the first person to make a spreadsheet for their personal life outside of work for friends and family but I like the idea of running my life like a business, in a good way.</p>

                <p>
                    I have my PS4 using youtube to play a video of rain hitting the ground.  It's very soothing.  And then I just laid down and thought about what I really wanted to do.  Free of distractions.  No ads, no lyrics, just free time to think.  That was when I came up with the idea of listing names and then eventually it made sense to make a spreadsheet.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I want to be a better friend, brother, son, uncle, and everything.  I realized there are a lot of people I would love to reconnect with but I don't have their number in my new phone.  So I charged my old phone and added their numbers to the spreadsheet.  I texted an old friend and my sister and both were great.  The friend is making a meme app and I may try to make a meme creator website again, since my first one was pretty cool, but not user-friendly.
                </p>
                <p>
                    They say you can really only know 250 people.  Something about the sustainable size of a tribe we are evolved to keep track of.  I guess my goal of the spreadsheet would be to have 250 people I care about, and I'm on good terms with.  I had a robust circle of friends during highschool and it's been difficult for me to maintain that as I've gotten older.
                </p>
                <p>I'll be 30 in September.  That means no more excuses.  No more young and stupid.  No more fucking around.  I'm going to try to have a good life, and ignore unimportant distractions.  You have to understand, there are so many companies vying for your attention.  It's hard to get through the day!  The Social Dilemna Documentary does a great job of showing that.  And yes, I spelled Dilemna correctly, it's this reality that's incorrect, not me.</p>

                    <h3>02/09</h3>
                    <p>My two favorite voices I've found online are Jonathan Adampants and Quantum Conscience.</p>
                    <p>I believe these guys are the best and I'm going to try to explain why and what their messages have in common.  What they say is that conspiracy theorists are on the same level as everyone else.  They aren't better.  So even if you know something someone else does not know, if you obsess about it and let it consume you, what do you really know?  Nothing.  In fact, a lot of truth movements are fake and designed to suck you into a black hole with no clear answers or benefit to you.  Real truth has benefit.  It allows you to live your life better.  That's what these guys are about.  "Stop chasing the rabbit, put your rifle down" is what Quantum Conscience says.  Adampants says you have the "awake" people and they are just another category of people programmed by society.  He says if you magnetically bond to a conspiracy theory now you're way off your path, and when I heard that it really helped me regain some of myself.    </p>
                    <p>The common theme between them is that you have to stop looking outside of yourself for answers.  Truth comes from within.</p>

                        The purpose of this site
                    </h2>
                    <h3>02/06/21</h3>
                    <p>
                        It might seem like the purpose of this site is to convince you not to take the vaccine or to believe in conspiracy theories.  It's not.  I think that's just what's on here right now because it's something I have trouble sharing with people in real life and I had it pent up and just put it all here first thing.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        One of the main reasons for this website is to practice coding.  It's a skill I learned that I want to continue to grow.  I miss coding when I stop doing it.  I like this site because it's like a very basic foundation designed to be a skeleton I can build on.  
                    </p>
                    <p>Another purpose of this website is to show off my life's work.  I have call of duty montages, chess ratings, an album of original music.  I have photoshop art, a poem and a story.  I have an essay, and my education and credentials.  It's not just to show off, it's more like I'm organizing everything I've ever done so I can see what I want to work on and what I can leave alone.</p>
        
                    <p>I also want to be able to share my thoughts on entertainment with reviews.  I also want to share my strategy with competitive video games because I'm usually very successful in online gaming once I discover a winning strategy.</p>
        
                    <p>In Call of Duty Cold war I use a silenced Ak74u and a Sniper rifle with ghost ninja and spycraft.  It enables you to play comfortably because no one ever sees you coming and you always have an advantage at any range because the sniper dominates long range and the ak74u can handle anything else.  But that's far from my best online strategy.  I was completely unstoppable in MW3 with a Type 95 and a pp90.  Basically in COD you want to have 2 weapons and pick your battles carefully.</p>
        
                    <p>
                        In Gears of War 3 I would use 2 shotguns by starting with a sawed off, killing someone and grabbing their gnasher.  Then I'd run around with the sawed off and be able to switch to the gnasher instead of reloading the sawed off, and that strategy really does dominate, but the game is outdated.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I miss Halo.  What a great game that was, but I prefer playstation.  God of War and The Last of Us 1 and 2 are so unbelievably good it's just astounding.  And Spiderman is fun to swing around in for sure. I loved Gears and Halo 3 but the sequels were getting progressively worse, so I switched to Playstation 4 for the superior single player experience.
                    </p>
                    <p>What do I hope to accomplish with this site? Well, it's like therapy to me.  It's like a rubber band ball; I keep adding to it and eventually it can bounce.  I always feel like it's time well spent when I code this because it keeps my skills fresh.  I also have an outlet to put my ideas out into the world without the politics of facebook.  
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        So ya, this site is multipurpose.  I'm kind of just seeing what I can do.  I'm saying to the world, here I am.  This is all me.  I made this.  Here's everything I've ever done and am doing.  Take it or leave it.

                        This was the first video where I heard Jonathan Adampants.  Later on I decided I wanted to hear more and discovered his full videos.  This is just a provacative montage.  This video is no longer allowed on youtube, so you know it's good.  Enjoy.

                    <p>Thank you, Russell Brand.  My first impression of Russell Brand was when he was Aldus Snow in Forgetting Sarah Marshall.  He made that movie and was an instant sensation.  Then I started to see the real Russell Brand talking on youtube.  I found him to be pretentious, but I think now he's gotten a lot better at his delivery.  I think he's not just some actor spouting philosophy, he's actually gotten a lot of practice delving into complicated ideas that I think he's quite good now.</p>  
        
                    <p>It's like a breath of fresh air to hear someone prominent talk about the dangers we're facing.</p>

                    <p>
                        I can't go to the movies.
        </p><p>
        There is a sign posted outside the local movie theater.
        </p><p>
        It says, "We are closed until local and state government guidelines allow us to reopen."
        </p><p>
        Translation: this private company would like to be open, but your governor has forbid us to be open.  He has taken away your right to go to the movies, and our right to provide them to you.
        </p><p>
        Guidelines.  They call them guidelines.  They are not.  They are dictates.  They are unlawful.  They are an infringement on our rights. 
        </p><p>
        Now I went to the theater and saw Tenet the moment it opened.  There were ridiculous rules like wearing mask at all times and having employees get you drinks in a separate section, but it was still enjoyable, to be free.  Even that wasn't good enough for them.  They had to shut it down for what?  For my safety?  Or for total control of what the population can or cannot do with their free will?
        </p><p>
        It is disgusting that these governors can prevent us from going to the movies in the name of public safety. It's a joke.  It's a scam.  It's a lie. If they care about health then why are we able to buy alcohol and tobacco?
        </p><p>
        They only care about control.  Dominion.
