            <p>
                This is a post for someone who believes in the general consensus of how the world works, but is open to information that challenges their world view.  
            </p>
            <p>I've included a video of chapter 1 of a book for the conspiracy noobie.  Someone who knows something isn't quite right with the fact that we went to the moon 52 years ago and haven't gone since.  All the computer stuff that happened?  Who needs that!  Maybe someone who thinks Lee Harvey Oswald didn't singlehandedly take down the president with a magic bullet as he conveniently drove by his place of work in a convertable and no one used the upper floors.</p>
            <p>Maybe they find it hard to believe that 6 guys with box cutters hijacked planes and managed to strike the Pentagon, and the twin towers while all the fighter jets were confused by the hijacking training excersise scheduled for that day.</p>
            <p>Maybe they're wondering why the buildings collapsed suddenly at near free fall speed as if it was a controlled demolition when the only damage was in the upper floors.</p>
            <p>
                I guess if anyone could find this useful it would be a young person, maybe 18, who isn't entreched in his world view yet.  
            </p>
            <p>If you think it's the Rebuplicans vs. Democrats and we live in a democracy by the people and for the people then this isn't for you.  If, on the other hand, you've noticed that no matter who gets elected, the government pulls the same shit then maybe you're open to learning about why.  I view these things as kindergarden level because I've been doing this for a decade, but you have to start somewhere.</p>
            <p>The amazing chasm between someone in the know and someone not in the know is so incredibly large and uncrossable that I'm not sure what to do.  It's supernatural how difficult it is to explain to someone basically anything that goes against what the news presents as real. </p>
            <p>
                I see young healthy people in their car with their mask on alone.  How much more brainwashed could you possibly be?  
            </p>
            <p>
                And here's the creepiest part.  There is a recent Mandela Effect where Selma Hayek's name has changed to Salma Hayek and has always been Salma.  I knew my Dad was a fan of Selma Hayek and thought she was pretty, so I called him up.  "Dad, what's the name of that actress who's last name is hayek?"  "Selma!  Selma Hayek" He says.  Then I ask him, "Could you spell it for me please"  "S-E-L-M-A"  I say, "Ok, for a brand new car in this game show, is that your final answer?" "Yes."  "Okay, google it.  Gotta go!"
            </p>
            <p>
                After googling it and seeing that her name is now and always has been "Salma" which sounds ugly, first of all, after seeing that he texts me basically saying, "Oops, and I should know that because I just pitched her a screenplay."  So not only is he a fan, he's practically a collegue, and it didn't even cross his mind to use an A instead of an E when a car was on the line.  Now after a quick google, he's 100% sure he was mistaken because obviously google has it correct.
            </p>
            <p>Yes they do, and her name has always been Salma.  But here's where it gets really creepy.  We argue about it for a while and by the end of it he texts me.  "I love it.  I love the spelling with the A.  It's beautiful."  So that's what we're dealing with.  Not only will people completely disregard their own memory and immediately take the google download of information, but they love it!  That's what we're dealing with.  He wasn't even bothered by his misspelling of it within a few hours.  He actually prefers the information spoonfed to him as opposed to having his own opinion.  Granted it's a tall order to remodel your reality model based on one celebrity's name but to love it and call it beautiful when it's actually an ugly ass name that sticks out like a sore thumb and you would have been out a brand new car if you were on a real game show?  To love it just creeps me the fuck out, it really does.  It reminds me of Winston loving Big Brother by the end of 1984.  </p>
            <p>Now, I love my Dad and I don't care that he doesn't accept the Mandela Effect.  Whatever.  There are more important things in life that he knows way more about than me but I wanted to share that creepy story to let you know what we're up against.  </p>
            <p>
                You don't need to be a structual engineer or a demolition expert to know that the twin towers didn't fall because of a pancake effect from the top floor giving out due to a fire.  You just need common sense.  I don't know what's going on here.  It's like some weird trick of the Devil.  It's virtually impossible to explain to someone the simplest little thing that contracticts their version of reality.  In Fairness the Bible does say that the Devil deceiveth the whole world and that you will be persecuted for following the path of Christ but I just never imagined it would be like this.  It's like I'm speaking a different language!  
            </p>
            <p>
                This post is for no one!  There is NO ONE.  You can call me crazy but at least I know to go for the bottom jenga block to make it collapse.  Good luck pulling from the second from the top and hoping a pancake effect collapses the whole thing.  
            </p>
            <p>
                So how do I know I'm not crazy?  I don't know.  I can checkmate you with my eyes closed or drop a nuke on you in call of duty.  I can get a college degree and a coding dojo certificate and code this whole website.  I've been crazy before.  I went full on crazy for like a month, but even then, at my worst, I still had more truth in me than the average zombie who thinks our response to covid 19 is perfectly reasonable.  
            </p>
            <p>
                It's probably not even possible to study all this stuff without going crazy.  I don't think I get enough credit for trying.  Sure, I lost it for a couple weeks but that's what this shit can do to you.  When you realize everything is a lie why not question whether you really need sleep?  Which is what I did to cause my poor judgement during that period of time.  But who cares?  I go crazy for a month during 10 years of researching how fake reality is and I think that deserves a medal or something.  I probably beat the odds.  Maybe that's why it's so hard for people to consider even elementary conspiracy theories.  It's maddening to deal with; it really is, and I don't think I get enough credit for trying to figure it out, but maybe that's what Jesus meant.  Forget about credit, I get ostracized.  My best friends are subconsciously terrified of me!  Of what I might say.  I'm like the luckiest guy in the world that I have 1 friend who actually can see it.  It's all so obvious I don't need confirmation from someone but it is definitely nice.
            </p>
            <p>
                Alex Jones, the face of the conspiracy theory, looked like death on the last Joe Rogan experience.  He says he can't do this anymore.  He even backed off of Sandy Hook because of the backlash he must have taken and look, there's no way you can study sandy hook conspiracy without becoming traumatized.  That's little kids dying.  It's as bad as it gets.  I don't know if Alex Jones is propped up by the system as controlled opposition or if Alex is even aware of it.  He helped open my mind up and move past him and my gut tells me that he believes in what he's saying and even believes sandy hook was a conspiracy but he felt he needed to back off of that scintillating issue to survive and make no mistake, it is killing him.  He's banned from certain platforms but overall I think the system finds him tolerable because he isn't handling it in the best way or the best role model for truthers.  
            </p>
            <p>
                Once you self-educate yourself and graduate from truther school you are supposed to move on and live your own life, avoiding the bullshit anderson pooper scooper spews out of his mouth. 
            </p>
            <p>On the bright side, if this life is a test and you aren't gobbling up anderson pooper scoopers dogshit then you've passed.  You have kept the faith.  There's still a lot of work to do but overall it's obvious they're trying to trick the population and whatever they want from that they aren't getting it from us, unless you're still stuck on sandy hook or 911 or pick your favorite conspiracy.  Understand it's bullshit, and move on.  It's impossible to use the evidence you find on other people anyway, so prove it to yourself and move on.</p>
            <p>
                In regards to Sandy Hook, I don't know what happened.  I haven't studied it in years, but I will never forget Robbie Parker, alleged father of the slain Emily Parker, who was laughing his ass off leading up to his somber press conference when he didn't realize he was on camera.  Again, if that isn't weird to you, then it's probably also not weird to you that we're trying to go to Mars when we haven't even been to the moon in 50 years.  That's similar to entering the olympics for swimming at age 50 when you haven't even swam since high school, and thinking you're going to get the gold medal.  That's actually a bad metaphor.  Let me think of a more apt one, because we never even went to moon at all. It's like someone claiming the pyramids were built by slaves thousands of years ago, but we still can't build them today, despite all the advancements in technology.  Well maybe they weren't built in the way you were told.  
            </p>
            <p>
                And if you think we haven't been to the moon since 1969 because we don't want to go well than how do you explain the fact that space is all the rage right now!  Look at what SpaceEX is supposedly doing besides embedding SEX in their name and shooting a black dick into space.  I liked Elon Musk, and the idea of him, but all of the sudden he's the richest man in the world?  The whole appeal of Elon was that he risked all his own money to bring us these badass companies that might fail so we should all buy his products and support him and now he's richer than Jeff Bezos?  The narrative just fell apart as far as I'm concerned and I just flat out don't believe him anymore. He's definitely the coolest dude on the planet but how real he is at this point I just don't know.  The SEX thing really is quite telling.  How about you go livestream on the moon first before selling us all on Mars, Elon?  I don't know.  Sometimes I think guys like him and even Einstein and Stephen Hawking are used to push lies.  Neil Degrasse Tyson's favorite thing to do is push lies.  I don't know if he even knows that they're lies.  Why did the big bang occur Neil?  
            </p>
            <p>
                Any public genius or intellectual who doesn't acknowledge the elephant in the room of the elementary level of conspiracies going on cannot be trusted.  Even Jordan Peterson who's taught me so much, and Elon who's inspired me, even they are suspect.  How could anyone be that smart and miss something so basic?  Well, one explanation is that I'm wrong, not them.  However, it's not debatable.  There's simply no way Lee Harvey Oswalds bullet could have done what it did, or the twin towers could have fallen the way that they did, without an alternate explanation.  So these public intellectual heroes are just a joke to me at this point.  
            </p>
            <p>
                The entire world is so far past insane that you couldn't pull them out of it in a million years, possibly eternity.  I haven't figured out why that is but I heard an interesting theory that it's because of something they've already decided in the future that's affecting their past which is right now.   I had never thought about that before.   I know the present can affect the past but I forgot about the future affecting the present under the same principle of retrocausality.   And again, I'd much rather talk about retrocausality and Parallel Universes and the teaching of Jesus than Lee Harvey Oswald but these people wouldn't pass the first day of kindergarden of a real school designed to actually help you learn. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Our school system is a complete joke.  That alone is proof of everything I'm saying.  You know school's a bunch of bullshit; you went through it. You could make it through Ivy League with a post graduate degree and still be a total moron by objective standards.  A total moron who thinks it's red vs. blue and not the royal color of purple.  You know how they call it "left wing" and "right wing"?  Has it ever occured to you that the left wing and right wing can be two wings of the same beast?  It doesn't care what wing you worship if it stays perched on the throne, you idiots!  I'm sorry but what else can I say?
            </p>
            <p>
                This isn't for you, this is for me so I don't go crazy again.  If you want to know what I think, you can come here for a unique perspective.  I'm not posting it on facebook so it shows up on your news feed in between cat videos and selfies.  I'm just telling it like it is for anyone who has two brain cells left to rub together. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I don't think I'm some supergenius who can see things others cannot.  There's some truth to that as I am in the top like 1% of chess players in the world but thinking hasn't been my strongsuit.  I've lived a well-rounded life with Athletics, and girls, and parties, and I think my talent and purpose lies in my ability to relate to anyone in person and to kind of meet you on your level.  I can speak confidently in a crowd and have leadership and teaching ability.  But I'm not a supergenius.  I'm just frustrated that no one can see the most basic of things about this reality.
            </p>
            <p>
                There's something spiritual going on where maybe I'm an old soul or a different type of incarnation than the vast majority of people who can't see with their own eyes anymore unless the news tells them what they're seeing. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I don't hate you.  Do I think I'm better than you?  Maybe, but I recognize that as a flaw.  I think there's a ton wrong with me and the world is somehow a reflection of myself because I'm part of it and it is sick so I must be sick as well.
            </p>
            <p>
                In a scenario like this where 1984 is coming to life and the ministry of truth is starting to censor more and more "fake information" there's little to look forward to other than the coming of Jesus.  
            </p>
            <p>
                I'm actually kind of mad at myself for not predicting this virus crisis, so I'm going to try to predict the next thing.  The virus is like their evil little plan to put everyone in masks and keep us separated to basically divide and conquer our souls.  So what's next?  They rode the terrorism train about as long as they could before they had to come up with the next phase of a virus crisis.  So what's next?
            </p>
            <p>One idea I have is that they'll claim to discover a "murder gene" and they'll use it to be able to genetically modify all babies at birth, to install whatever programs they want into them to truly make people subhuman.</p>

            <p>That's one direction they could go when we get tired of the virus business, or they at least accomplish what they want to with the virus and then choose to move on.</p>

            <p>
                Remember they said 2 weeks and it's been idk 2 years maybe?  Whatever.  Do you know I wouldn't even be surpised if I was kidnapped by reptilians in the night who threatened to kill me if I stopped making this website.  I would laugh and roll my eyes at them.  That's how fucking batshit this all is.  Nothing, and I mean absolutely nothing, would surpise me.  The only thing that would surpise me is if everything got fixed and only the truth prevailed barring Jesus coming back.
            </p>
            <p>
                Okay so if I had to try to predict another manufactured crisis I'm trying to think of what they want to do to us next.  Let's see, we've hacked all their emails and phone calls, we've put them under house arrest and put them in masks... what else can we do?  Maybe modify their genes at birth like I said.  Maybe... maybe we could have them use autopilot!?  That's it.  You know like the movie Click?  When he fast-forwards and misses all the little things in life, and he's just a zombie?  I bet you that will happen in reality someday where technology will give people the option of automating their own bodies for certain periods of time and then get to use their brains and bodies when they get home from work for a few hours.  Idk.  Would that surpise me if people lined up for that?  No, it would not.  
            </p>

            <p>
                So we could genetically modify them at birth, we could get them to completely surrender their consciousness to us to fast forward their conscious experience... what else could we make them do?  And trust me I'm not giving the Devil any Ideas; he's way smarter than 1000 me's put together.  I'm just trying to think it through.   Let's see...  we could get rid of the men, just make a population of women to serve us and have the sperm banks somehow stay operational.  Not sure how they'd pull that one off but they certainly want not only men gone but women two.  So there would have to be a push towards a genderless society.  Lets see, we've already kind of broken down the family, and attacked masculinity as toxic and feminity as inferior... Let's make them learn from the government instead of their parents!  "Hey Satan"  A gargoyle yelled.  "yes?" Satan asked.  "We already did that one."  "Oh yes, I forgot, common core is my favorite."


            </p>

            <p>
                What does the Devil have for us next?  
            </p>
            <p>
                How about fake aliens!  That seems like it's already underway.  That's probably it.  So they'll probably have elon musk's black space dick make contact with a fake alien civilization that wants to come live with us.  Sure! Come on down.  Then we'll have demons walking around interbreeding with us, I don't know.  Would that surpise me if we made contact with aliens in the next 10 years and somehow it was a conspiracy to gain more power over us humans and dehumanize us further?  No, it would not surprise me.  And no, save your comments about my own sanity and take yourself to the shrink for both of us and ask for the placebo intsead of your pills because they're just as effective, and they're cheap and taste better. 
            </p>
            <p>
                You can take a sugar pill and experience the same effects as a drug.  Okay?  That tells you all you need to know about reality.  Some people shrug it off as insignificant and I haven't learned how to not see those people as total morons.  The Placebo effect changes everything and is verifiable proof that your mind has way more power then your world view allows for.  Government is... wait for it... dare I say.... governing your mentality?  Is that too much of a stretch there for ya? Ya, I thought so.  Again, a post for no one.

                <h2>The Philosophy of Science</h2>
                <h3>02/24/21</h3>
                <p>
                    My friend has challenged me to prove the mandela effect in a scientific way.  I'm a philosphy major, not a science major, but I did take a class on the philosophy of science. Unfortunately for me, I didn't read the books I was assigned.  However, I have a big book on my bookshelf by Karl Popper called "The Logic of Scientific Discovery" that I've been waiting until I'm mature enough to read.  I just pulled it out and opened to a random page and found the perfect quote:
                </p>
                    <p>
                    "With the idol of certainty (including that of degrees of imperfect certainty or probability) there falls one of the defences of obscurantism which bar the way of scientific advance.  For the worship of this idol hampers not only the boldness of our questions, but also the rigour and the integrity of our tests. The wrong view of science betrays itself in the craving to be right; for it is not his possession of knowledge, of irrefutable truth, that makes the man of science, but his persistant and recklessly critical quest for truth."(p281).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        My interpretation of that quote is that true science is not limited by certainty.  So if my friend wants a shallow understanding of something as complicated as the Mandela Effect then I cannot oblige.  Karl Popper is saying that the traditional view of science as only what can be irrefutably proven is the wrong view and actually limits the questions we ask and restricts us from reaching the truth.  That is why I say that view of science is shallow.  It's narrow.  It's vain.  It's unhelpful.  The real man of science is someone who is persistant in his quest for truth.  Dare I say, a truther?  I actually like the term truther and feel it describes me much better than the weaponized term of conspiracy theorist.  At my core, I'm on a quest for the truth, no matter where it takes me, no matter how foolish I may seem to others.  An insecure mind, would seek only knowledge that can be irrefutably proven to others.  I think it's time for these types of minds to wade past the shallow end of the pool of knowledge and come swim with me in the deep end.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Do you want to be right?  Or do you want the truth?  
                    </p>
                    <h3>Part 2</h3>
                    <p>
                        Now I will begin the correct type of scientific inquiry into the Mandela Effect.  Two things spring to mind.
                    </p>
                    <h4>1. Someone who doesn't belive in the Mandela Effect has to discount every single instance of the phenomenon.  In every single example of large groups of people sharing false memories, the only explanation is that they are confabulating or misremembering in 100% of occurances.</h4>
                    <h4>2. Every single piece of "residue" or hard evidence of the false memory being real must be discounted as fake or a typo if it is a printed misspelling of someone's name.</h4>

                    <p>
                        Another thing that springs to mind is the non-believer of the mandela effect must also discount his own memories!  For example, I asked him where the Statue of Liberty is.  He said Ellis Island as did another person listening.  No one said what is now considered by Google to be the correct answer,  "Liberty Island."  
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The psychology of the nonbeliever is interesting because in that Statue of Liberty example they have 2 choices.  
                    </p>
                    <h4>1. Discount their personal memory as false and try to "take the download" of the new fact of Liberty Island.</h4>
                    <h4>2. Reexamine and potentially remodel their model of reality.</h4>
                    <p>The nonbeliever chooses to discount their own memory rather than reality itself.</p>
                    <p>That is perfectly understandabe.  However, how far would you let it go?  Suppose there were suddenly 364 days in a year and everyone acted like it was always that way.  Would you go with option 2 then?  In other words, would that be too far or not enough?</p>
                    <p>For me, I know how to spell.  I know how to spell dilemna.  Suddenly it's supposed to be dilemma and sorry but that's a dealbreaker for me.</p>
                    <p>
                    With the statue of Liberty Example, there are pictures of people on Ellis Island posing next to what they think is the Statue of Liberty only in the picture they are posing next to nothing at all because it isn't there.  That's not irrefutable proof but it is staring at you in the face.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        My favorite example of this is the Thinker.  The Thinker is a statue of a man with his fist on his forehead while he is in deep thought.  However, if you google it he is resting his chin on his hand.  
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        There's a picture of a woman next to the statue posing in a similar fashion.  You would think the pose would match but she has her fist on her forehead whereas the statue in the picture has his chin on his hand. 
                    </p>
                    <div class="pic3">
                        <img src="static/img/thinker.jpeg" alt="thinker">
                    </div>
                    <p>The infadel would have to conclude she is just stupid because there's no way the statue could have changed, she must just be posing incorrectly.</p>
                    <p>
                        Aristotle said, "It's the mark of an educated mind to be able to entertain a thought without accepting it." and I think that's necessary here.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Other types of hard evidence would be "Interview with a Vampire" or "Sex in the City" being printed in magazines or spoken by the people who made them.  You would think the person who wrote or starred in something would get the title correct, wouldn't you?  But people cling to their reality so desperately they probalby don't even look into the hard evidence because of what Aristotle said.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        So providing evidence is useless in this instance if you're incapable of entertaining the thought.  Did the monopoly man have a monacle?  Did Curious George have a tail?  Did pikachu have a black part of his tail?  Was Chick-Fil-A ever spelled Chic-fil-a or some other way?  Did Darth Vader say, "Luke, I am your father"?  Did Hannibal Lector ever say, "Hello Clarice".  If you build it, who will come?  
                    </p>
                    <h3>Part 3</h3>
                    <h4>If even one example of the mandela effect is true then the entire accepted model of reality breaks down because this reality's past is not the same as your past.  </h4>
                    <p>
                        I can't do it for you.  You have to decide for yourself that your memory is more than something to be discarded.  Perhaps it is to be cherished as sacred rather than discarded as trash.  Maybe you are more than this reality.  Maybe you aren't.  Not everyone is Mandela Effected.  Some people who believe in the effect have certain memories that contradict an accepted mandela effect within the truth community.  I don't have all the answers.  But I do ask the reckless questions.  And Karl Popper and Aristotle are on my side, in the deep end, where the answers lie beneath murky water.
                    </p>

And I'm supposed to be impressed by Dr. Fauci?  That guy's either a liar or a moron; pick your favorite.  This guy, Jonathan Adampants, is either a genius or a prophet.

                <h2>How Hollywood Portrays Human Nature, and How Actors who are known for something else are Frauds.</h2>
                <h3>2/20/21</h3>
                
                <p>1.) I think that the way people behave in the Movie Greenland is unrealistic.  For Example, in Greenland, this guy is giving Gerald Butler's wife and kid a ride, but of course he has to be evil so he violently throws her out of the car and kidnaps the kid.  I turned it off after that because there's no logical reason for it. Stealing both their bracelets and throwing them both out would make some sense.  I guess he wanted a kid?  Whatever.  I think that people are good and not willing to throw away their humanity and decency just for a shot at getting into a shelter from an asteroid.  I could be wrong.  I just think that Hollywood purposefully makes it so these people are acting like savages to give us the illusion that we'd descend into madness without government.  For example, in another dumb scene people are looting a Rite aid and the wife and kid are looking for insulin when suddenly a bunch of guys with guns come in and start shooting people.  First of all, there's no reason to shoot anyone because they don't have guns and are trying to escape.  I guess you could shoot one person in the leg and claim the store for your group if you want to post up but they literally shoot an old lady for no reason and kill her.  Then the wife is trying to hide and a black guy with a shotgun sees her.  She begs for her life, and he acts like it's a hard decision to make and then offers his hand to help her up, and then tells her to get out of here.  It's all very bizarre like as if he thought he was supposed to shoot a woman and child in cold blood... for what?  It's just ridiculous.  </p>
                <p>
                    In another scene the people break through the airport to try to get on a plane and then the miltary just open fires on people and they fire back and it's like again just kind of frantic and bizarre and overdone.  I get that people want to stay alive but there's more to this life than that.  I wouldn't shoot civililians if I was a soldier and I wouldn't shoot a soldier if I was a civililian. I don't know.  I get that it's a movie I just think they're pushing on us the idea that we'd rip each other apart without our current system but I don't think that's as true as they portray.  I also don't think they're doing it to make a better movie.  I am suggesting they do this on purpose.
                </p>
                <p>
                    2.)  The other thing I want to discuss is Bill Nye the Science Guy making an appearance in the Movie Bliss.  First of all the movie Bliss is a can of worms in it of itself which I think also depicts human nature in a purposefully bad light.  But we're moving on to the second topic of discussion which is Hollywood actors who are known for not acting.  For example, Bill Nye the science guy is known for educating kids about science in a fun way on his show.  That's all fine and good except then he suddenly has a decent role in a movie.  This makes him a serious actor and he has serious acting skills.  So, when you watch him talking about science on his show as himself, or even in an interview, and then you see him acting as a character in a movie, what's the difference?  How do you know he's telling the truth about science when he's a professsional actor.  Now, in Bill Nye's case this isn't very important but I bring him up because he died once and I stayed up all night reading every quote he had on brainy quote.  I basically donated a night of my life in honor of his death and I learned about him and appreciated him for teaching and thought it was too bad he left this world.  Then suddenly he's alive again in this reality and never died and I don't even know if there was a false report of his death or not in this reality but I thought he was dead.  Now he's alive and well apparently.  Whatever, he gives me the creeps now.  It's like he was resurrected.  The reason I bring this actor/scientist thing up is it happens in a much more significant way with Wolf Blitzer of CNN's the situation room.  Wolf Blitzer is the go to guy to cover an event like Sandy Hook's shooting.  Everyone grabs their tissues to cry and hangs on every word out of Wolf's mouth. But then, at the same time, he's appeared in mission impossible movies as an actor giving fake news reports of events that never happened. Trust me, I get that it's theoretically possible that he's an honest newsman on CNN, but then is offered a role in hollywood and says yes and gives a fake news broadcast.   But that should bother you.  Because what that's saying is that it is well within Wolf Blitzer's toolbox to say whatever he's paid to say regardless of its truth!  He clearly has no problem going in front of a camera and spewing bullshit and pretending it's news in mission impossible so is that not a little bit unsettling that he looks identical whether he's acting or reading the news?  What's to stop someone from paying him to tell fake news?  His morals?  Do you know the guy?  He's officially an actor!  I mean the director of mission impossible chose Wolf for his acting skills, idk.  It's just ridiculous if you really think about it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In my opinion, Bill Nye is a fraud.  Wolf Blitzer is a liar.  They are both professional actors not some of the time they're on camera, but 100% of the time.  I also think that were an asteroid headed for Earth to kill most of us we wouldn't immediately start shooting old ladies and kidnapping other people's children.  I think there would be some chaos for sure, but there would still be some good people doing good deeds.  And sorry, Greenland, not shooting a woman and child for no reason doesn't count as a good deed.

                <h2>Schrodinger's Covid</h2>
                <h3>02/19/21</h3>
                <p>
                    Schrodinger's Cat is a thought experiment where there's a cat in a box with a radioactive substance that may or may not kill him.  Please look it up if you've never heard of it or you will no have no chance understanding what I'm about to say.  Basically he argues the cat is both alive and dead at the same time, and only when you open the box does the cat become one or the other.  This agrees with the narrow slit experiment where waves become particles only when observed.  If you haven't heard of these experiments then please go learn quantum physics 101 before coming back here because this is Advanced Quantum Theory.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So I have a friend who wishes to remain anonymous.  We share the same world view although it is uncommon.  I wanted to do a podcast with him and call it "The Boys Who Cried Wolf" because I want to give him a chance to get his theory of reality out there because it's very intriguing.  He has Covid and cannot do the podcast and doesn't like writing it out so I will just do my best and he can correct me later on the podcast.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    His working theory is that reality is a matrix of possibilities and everything has already happened in a higher dimension where God's watching.  However, in our dimension, we are making choices that affect the reality we experience.  So it's like a choose your own adventure story, where God is the author and we are the reader.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now I'm going to try to apply his theory on a macro level and reconsile it with quantum physics and give a concrete example of how it might work.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Let me start with an example of the quantum reality.  The last time I spoke to my dad was earlier today.  There are a few different versions of him since then that are possible.  Right now, to me, he's like a wave of possibilities of different decisions he could have made since we spoke.  If I call him on the phone right now and ask him how his day went then that wave becomes particles.  Then I can actually pinpoint dates, times, and what he did.  But before I open the box, the cat is both dead and alive.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    Okay, so back to my anonymous friend.  He and I talk often.  He didn't tell me he had covid.  I learned from our third friend when I called him about his dog.  Now the third friend doesn't agree with me and my anonymous friend.  His worldview is different.  So what if, when I called the third friend, I interacted with his reality, which is different from my own.  And our realities merged.  So to my third friend, my anonymous friend has covid because it serves him right for being an anti-masker.  The poetic justice makes sense in his universe.  Anyway, by me calling him and him telling me that information about my anonymous friend, I then have merged with that universe and called my anonymous friend and sure enough he had covid.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If I had never made the call, and never found out from the third friend, then my anonymous friend would be a wave, maybe he has it, maybe he doesn't, but the wave would lean towards him not having it according to my world view.  But by exposing myself to a contrary universe I brought that into my own and the wave was forced to become a certain particle.  
                </p>
                <p>None of this will make any sense if you don't accept the idea that there are parallel universes overlapping all of the time in the way I'm describing.  Obviously, if there is only one physical universe then this doesn't make any sense.  However, if the cat is truly alive and dead at the same time, and the particle is truly a wave when you're not observing it, which it is, then this theory makes senes.  </p>
                <p>
                    If I haven't heard about a fourth friend in years, a larger wave of possibilities exists in my reality.  But when I speak to them I pinpoint it down to a particle.  But maybe the wave is just as true as the particle.  And whatever particle I eventually pin down is a reflection of my choices, who I talk to, etc.  
                </p>
                <p class="profound">
                    There are waves of possibilities that are just as real as the actual particulates of events that we discover.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our realities are not the same.  We can briefly share one by merging upon interaction, and then we break off again into separate realities.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Mandela effect could be the result of a merge conflict of the shared realities of people on the internet.  Many realities collided together on the internet and a new reality emerged which had to decide how to spell dilemna.  This reality went with Dilemma to upset the least amount of people in this reality bubble.  However, some people who came here from the dilemna reality feel left out and that's what the mandela effect is.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    I believe someone in this reality when they say it has always been dilemma for them and they are a good speller.  I also believe my own spelling of dilemna.  What if both were true but then our realities collided and merged and that created a merge conflict of the spelling of that word and this reality decided on dilemma.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    Reality is not stagnant.  It is alive, changing, and making decisions.  It is forming itself based on the decisions/consciousness of its inhabitants.  I don't know how many realities there are but I know that this current reality has at least 2 branches in it's history.
                </p>
                <p>Now that I think of it, the best explanation for all of this is that reality is created by consciousness.  Our thoughts are literally shaping reality into form.  Reality has been changing according to our thoughts.  Reality is designed to fit whatever thoughts we project onto it.</p>
                <p>We all have our own reality responding to our own consciousness, but it also responds to other people's consciousness.  Other people are just as real as us, but they may be tuned to a different frequency or radio station (reality station).</p>

                <p>
                    My anonymous friend likes to say when we're on the phone that we are speaking to the version of the other person that made all the decisions to lead up to that phone call, but that there are other versions as well that are equally real.  And whose to say we aren't tuned in to only one at a time?  And can we change the channel?  I think we can.  I think I have.  I think the universe I'm in now is not the universe I grew up in, and I think it's because of decisions that I made along the way.
                </p>
                <p>I get that this all seems crazy but it's an advanced quantum theory of consciousness and reality so what did you expect?</p>
                <p>And how do you know what death is?  What if when you're about to die in a horrible car crash God can pick you up and place you in a reality where you didn't die and keep watching you?</p>
                <p>How many times have you already died?</p>
                <p class="profound">
                    What if no one really dies?  What if the people who aren't you can die in your reality and still be alive in theirs?
                </p>
                <p>
                    How do you know what life, death, reality, consciousness and God are?
                </p>

            <h2>Cocktail Party</h2>
            <h3>2/17/21</h3>
            <p>

I know how to sound smart at a cocktail party.  I know what's thought of as smart, and what's thought of as crazy.  Let's examine the underlining theme of what is accepted as intelligent, and what is rejected as crazy.  So in this exercise, I assume all of what's accepted as either true or false, and see what the effect of having these beliefs has on your subconscious mind.  
            </p>
            <h4>History of the World (Accepted)</h4>
            <p>
1.  There was a big bang and then physical matter produced consciousness<br>
2.  Evolution turned a monkey into a person and that's how you were created<br>
3. We put a man on the moon in 1969<br>
4.  911 was a terrorist attack and Osama Bin Laden was responsible<br>
5.  Everyone who shares false memories is simply misremembering and reality has always been the same.<br>
6. The Coronavirus is real and came from a bat and is so dangerous that we have to wear masks at all times, socially distance, and stay inside.<br>
7.  The vaccine is super safe.<br>
            </p>
<h4>Accepted Beliefs' Subconscious Conclusion:</h4>
<p>
    You are here by accident.  You are a advanced version of a monkey created by chance.  Man walked on the moon in 1969  but hasn't been able to do it since, despite all the technological advances in 2021 (52 years).  America is in danger of attacks from terrorists in the middle east who don't like our freedom.  The world is in danger of a deadly virus and has to wear masks at all times, avoid getting within 6 feet of another person, and should take an experimental vaccine that was developed in less than a year.  They should keep wearing the mask after getting vaccinated, and keep getting vaccinated every year.
</p>
        <h4>Translation:  You're here by accident and should be very afraid.</h4>


        <h4>History of the World (Rejected)</h4>
        <p>
1.  Consciousness came before the physical reality<br>
2.  You were created by God<br>
3.  We haven't been to the moon<br>
4. 911 was an inside job<br>
5. The Mandela Effect is evidence that reality is unstable<br>
6. The Coronavirus is fake, manmade and hardly worth fussing over<br>
7.  The vaccine is dangerous<br>
</p>
<h4>Rejected Beliefs' Subconscious Conclusion:</h4>
<p>
    You are here for a reason.  God created you and loves you.  We have not been able to walk on the moon.  Your country is not under a serious threat of terrorism.  Reality is changing somehow and many people share memories of it being different.  The Coronavirus was made to scare you but it's nothing to worry about, you can take off your mask and get close to people.  The vaccine is experimental and not necessary.
</p>

<h4>Translation :  You're here for a reason and there's nothing to fear.</h4>

<h3 class="profound">Option A (accepted by society as smart) You're here by accident and should be very afraid.</h3>
<h3 class="profound">Option B (accepted by society as crazy) You're here for a reason and there's nothing to fear.</h3>
<p>Which do you choose?</p>

            My thoughts on Cocktail Party

Hi Max! 
<br>


Read your Cocktail Party blog...
<br>
Just thought I’d share my thoughts/views on your two lists of accepted vs rejected reality.
<br>
Your list of what is “accepted” vs “rejected” and my thoughts on it:

<br>

1. There was a big bang and then physical matter produced consciousness vs.
Consciousness came before the physical reality
<br>
What I believe: I lean heavily toward consciousness came before reality. I think more and more people (at least the ones I talk to) lean this way too. I think people are increasingly unsatisfied with the theory of the “big bang” – it just doesn’t explain how we, and all our amazing intricacies came into being. The “reality” that it’s the Big Bang that started all… this… is not universally accepted.
<br>

2. Evolution turned a monkey into a person and that's how you were created vs.
You were created by God
<br>
What I believe: I have trouble picking between these two options. I get Darwin. I get evolution. But, I have a liiiiiitle trouble buying that I evolved into me, from a monkey. I get it. Millions of years of evolution…maybe it resulted in us. Maybe. But I don’t subscribe to that as my reality.
Likewise… “I was created by God”. Ok. What exactly does that mean? That could mean God created me through evolution – monkey to man. Or, when you say “created by God” do you mean, God spoke, and suddenly, I was? How do you define “created by God”? What even is “God”. And, what does that “creation” look like? How did he do it?
<br>
I 100% believe that I am not my body. I 100% believe that I am energy. And, when I die, I won’t.
<br>
I also, 100% don’t know who created me… who created, ME. Not my physical form (thanks mom and dad), but my energy. Where did THAT come from? Not a monkey. Maybe from God… but what is God?
<br>
3. We put a man on the moon in 1969 vs. We haven't been to the moon
<br>
What I believe: I’m not sure how this is really relevant. It feels like a distraction. Does it matter one way or another if we went to the moon or not? If it does, why? Perhaps we haven’t ever been back to the moon, because we already did it. Why do it again?
<br>
4. 911 was a terrorist attack and Osama Bin Laden was responsible vs. 911 was an inside job.
<br>
What I believe: Admittedly, I don’t spend a lot (or any) time thinking about things like #3 and #4. What if 911 was a legit terrorist attack? What if it was an inside job? There are a lot of really shitty people in the world that want to cause you harm because, they’re shitty.  Those shitty people are from foreign countries, and from right here in the US. So… in that regard, 911 was the same awful event whether it was an inside job or not. Shitty people doing shitty things. Shitty things are always going happen on small and large scales, because, shitty people are out there. Everywhere.
<br>
5. Everyone who shares false memories is simply misremembering and reality has always been the same. Vs. The Mandela Effect is evidence that reality is unstable
<br>
What I believe: I believe things change, and brands get rebranded. It happens ALL THE TIME. I’ve worked in enough corporate environments to have seen it done, over and over. So, if someone remembers Jiffy vs Jiff, or Berenstein vs Berenstain? I could mean BOTH are true. And, at some point the decision was made to change the name. Now, when you talk about memories such as, did Mandela die in prison, or not… then it gets a little weirder, and maybe it is a glitch in the simulation.
I also know that memories are extremely faulty. So, is “Everyone who shares false memories simply misremembering…?” No. But some are. And, “reality has always been the same.” Reality is EXTREMELY subjective. So, it’s NEVER the same for everyone.
<br>
The Mandela Effect is a fun way to classify our sketchy memories. Maybe reality is shifting. But then again, it’s constantly shifting based on our evolving consciousness.

<br>
6. The Coronavirus is real and came from a bat and is so dangerous that we have to wear masks at all times, socially distance, and stay inside. Vs. The Coronavirus is fake, manmade and hardly worth fussing over

<br>
What I believe: Is somewhere in the middle of the two choices you’ve proposed. I don’t believe I have to wear a mask “at all times”, or stay away from people all the time, or stay inside. That’s ridiculous. But I also accept that for some people, the coronavirus is way worse than the “flu”. I’ve heard of too many accounts (through friends and family) of people (otherwise healthy) who have gotten it and either died, or are still dealing with repercussions from it. My cousin has had it twice. He’s still dealing with breathing problems, and he had it back in November. So, it’s not nothing, and I’m willing to wear a mask in crowded public places to not be a dick to someone who might be very susceptible to it. But, I’m also going to carry on with my life, and do what I think it ok for ME.

 
<br>
7. The vaccine is super safe. Vs The vaccine is dangerous

 
<br>
What I believe: I don’t believe the vaccine is “super safe”, but I’m also happy my parents are getting it, so I also don’t think it’s “dangerous”. Again, it’s not a black and white thing here.

 
<br>
Translations: You're here by accident and should be very afraid. Vs You're here for a reason and there's nothing to fear.
<br>
What I think: We’re here for a reason, and ultimately (looking at the BIG picture) there’s nothing to fear. But that doesn’t mean bad things won’t happen. That doesn’t mean you won’t be afraid sometimes. We all make up this “reality”. And each of us individually have the power to affect someone else’s reality with our actions, or inactions. “Reality” is not this, or that. It has many shades of grey. It is fluid and constantly changing. 

<br>
LOVE!

                Matt uses a great metaphor in this one.  The truth is uncovered based on the way we are attacked by this world.  They don't go only for your body. The go for your mind too.  And they go for your soul.   But you have to give it willingly.  Based upon the way all these tricks are played.  Matt asks why would they play all these tricks if they could get just get it by force or couldn't get it at all.  The sheer amount of trickery played is a dead giveaway that we have souls and we sometimes give them away.
            </p>
            <p>
                Matthew 10:28 
                And be not afraid of them that kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul: but rather fear him who is able to destroy both soul and body in hell.
            </p>
            <p>He also makes a brilliant point against hell.  Suffering for eternity based on one lifetime here on Earth would be like a teacher handing out final grades on the first day of school as the children walked into the classroom.  It's absurd.</p>

            <p>
                So do not let this reality convince you to punish yourself.  You can walk confidently out on the playground because that big scary bully can't even touch you.  All he can do is try to convince you to hurt yourself.  Those appear to be the rules to this life. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I spent a decade researching everything and I could tell you so many things it would make your head spin but no worldly facts are anywhere near as important as the lesson of the bully who can only beat you up by convincing you to do it to yourself.

                This is too funny.  I know that I had Jiffy Peanut Butter as a kid.  And there are burgers named after it... and people don't know what's going on.  It's honestly hilarious as this guy calls different restaurants to ask them why it's called a Jiffy Burger.

                This is a perfect example of predictive programming.  Predictive programming is when Hollywood puts out new concepts that we can get comfortably acquainted with in movies before they implement it in reality.  In this movie you have Covid 23 mutating and the department of sanitation going door to door and placing people in Q zones.  That means they are planning to do those things.  It won't be as blatant as the movie but people will be more likely to accept it since they've already seen it in a movie.  This is honestly the most obvious example I've ever seen except it hasn't happened yet so I guess we'll see.

            <h2>Torture Chamber</h2>
            <h3>2/13/21</h3>
            <p>My coworker tells me to look on the bright side.  My best friend tells me to stop blaming the government for my own unhappiness. In this post, I'm going to share when I was unhappy, and how that's no longer the case.  I'm going to try to explain the difference between personal unhappiness, and environmental unhappiness.
            </p>
            <p>
                I have been unhappy before.  I have sufferered daily with severe anxiety for years at a time.  I know what Hell on Earth is.  I also know what Heaven on Earth is.  Heaven was when I was in love with my highschool sweetheart, through the first year of college.  Hell is what happened shortly after I moved off campus during my sophomore year, and my girlfriend broke up with me and wouldn't visit.  
            </p>
            <p>
                I tried to get her back, but I knew I couldn't visit her at her school, and she wouldn't visit me, so I tried to get her back through writing songs, texts, and emails.  This was a hopeless endeavor. By focusing on how I appeared through digital long distance, I let my physical self go.  It wasn't like I could gel my hair and knock on her door.  I let that part of myself go.  
            </p>
            <p>
                I was so sad that when I wasn't writing love songs I was trying to forget about it by playing call of duty and smoking marijuana.  I would skip class because it was too much of a shock to suddenly be on campus surrounded by hundreds of people when I had been alone in my room for so long leading up to it.  I started getting terrible anxiety from all the weed and isolation.
            </p>
            <p>
                I eventually developed Paruresis which is a condition where you have a shy bladder and can't urninate in public, except mine was so bad, I basically couldn't urinate at home if other people were there.  I was feeling very inadequate with not having a girlfriend anymore too so I was feeling very insecure and was just destroyed by Paruresis.  It got so bad it became my main reason for skipping class until I failed out of UCSC and came back home.
            </p>
            <p>
                I was so embarrassed I couldn't tell anyone what I was going through.  Finally I told my Mom.  Eventaully I was telling my Dad, and my best friends.  Now, I'm telling the world.  Honestly it doesn't matter to me anymore, and the more people you tell the less serious it becomes.  I don't suffer from anxiety anymore.  I don't live in a personal hell.  In those days, I could have been at a concert at UCSC with a beautiful ocean view and beautiful girls dancing and I would have been having a terrible time and thinking about going to the bathroom.  I would go to the bathroom, lock the door, try and fail to pee, and then go back out, then try again in 5 minutes.  It was painful and horrible.  I wouldn't drink anything in public, because I didn't like having to use the restroom in public, so I was dehydrated.  That is how I define personal unhappiness. Regardless of my environment, I was unhappy.
            </p>
            <p>
                Eventually I came home, told some people, read a book about OCD called Brain Lock, and then gradually got over the problem.  I went to Moorpark College to get good grades to get back into UCSC.  I eventually overcame my anxiety and graduated from UCSC with a cute girlfriend. 
                My personal Hell was over, and has been over since.  I know the tricks of how to deal with anxiety or depression (without meds) and my personal hell is so far away it's hard to believe that was the same person. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Now, I want to talk about environmental hell.  In Man's Search for Meaning, Victor Frankl tells a story of his experience in a concentration camp.  I'm not in one of those, but my point is that he had his mind right, but he was in environmental hell.  No one would blame Victor Frankl for saying something negative about his environment.  They wouldn't claim he was blaming the Nazi's for his own personal hell.  It really was hell closing in on him, and he would have to be blind not to see it and be bothered by it.
            </p>
            <p>
                So what kind of environmental hell am I claiming to be in?  Well, how about America today?  Let me explain, because it's very nuanced.  I'm not talking about America today for the average person.  No, the average person is completely oblivous to what I'm going through.
            </p>
            <p>
                So what am I going through?  Well first, let me tell you the story of Ignaz Semmelweis.  This man set out to solve the problem of babies and mothers dying at an alarming rate.
            </p>
            <p>
                Eventually he figured out, and proved to himself, that doctors were touching dead bodies and then delivering babies without washing their hands in between.  He didn't know the exact mechanism of the germs but he knew washing hands before delivering the babies would dramatically reduce the death rates of mothers and their newborn children.  
            </p>
            <p>
                At the time, doctors laughed at him and his theories, because there was no publicly accepted theory of germs at the time.
            </p>
            <p>
                This put Ignaz Semmelweis into an environmental hell.  It wasn't a personal hell.  He would be fine if they listened to him and the babies were saved.  It was an environmental hell because he was unable to convince anyone, or save any babies.
            </p>
            <p> This drove him insane.  He called the doctors, "Murderers" and ended up in a mental institution.</p>
            <p>History has proven him right, but his environment never did.</p>

            <p>
                What I'm going through, my personal struggle, is virtually identical to that.  My balance, is how do I accomplish what I wish to accomplish without going insane?  That is my dance.  That is my greatest challenge. 
            </p>
            <p>
                So what do I know that you don't?  Who is dying?  How can I save them?  What do I want to convince you of so badly that's it's already literally driven me insane??
            </p>
            <p>
                I cannot tell you.  Not only do you lack the patience, but so do I.  I'm just trying to at least establish the fact that I am in a torture chamber called America Today.  I am in environmental hell.
            </p>
            <p>I'll give you a hint.  My personal bliss is interrupted every time I see a mask.  Every time I hear people mention the vaccine, or social distancing.  It rips me apart.

            <p>
                Matt analyzes Groundhog day and talks about Bill Murray's journey from trying to exploit his situation, to attempting suicide, to saving people.  It's such a brilliant analysis I'm just at a loss for words...  
            </p>
            <p>There's really nothing to say.  I don't want this to be a quantum video every time but when he puts out pure gold what can you do.  I figured out one other common theme between him and Adampants.  They both speak to the act of saving another life, not for a reward, but for yourself.  Like Bill Murray has the power to save the kid's life falling out of the tree, and he knows he's not going to be thanked, he believes he's trapped in this day forever, and he still helps the kid.  Adampants talks about saving someone from drowning and what the reward would be.  He has this great line, "you get to heaven and God says here is your reward, you open the box, what's in there?" The point is that saving the person is the reward; anything else is trivial.  Adampants is the only truth I've found other than the occasional parable from Jesus.  We are so lucky to have this quantum of conscience guy creating content right now. It's just such a rare perspective and it's so close to the truth I can see the magnetism in the air.</p>

                    People, Time, and Spreadsheets
                </h2>
                <h3>02/10/21</h3>
                <p>
                    Have you ever felt like there wasn't enough time in a day?  I've dealt with that problem a lot but now I'm making an active effort to shut out distractions and focus on what's truly important.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I decided to make a spreadsheet of all the people I care about.  I have categories of people like family, extended family, friends, girls, men, and women.  Then I have a column for phone number, for their birthday, and when they last communicated with me, what they said, and what kind of terms we're on.  
                </p>
                <p>I'm probably not the first person to make a spreadsheet for their personal life outside of work for friends and family but I like the idea of running my life like a business, in a good way.</p>

                <p>
                    I have my PS4 using youtube to play a video of rain hitting the ground.  It's very soothing.  And then I just laid down and thought about what I really wanted to do.  Free of distractions.  No ads, no lyrics, just free time to think.  That was when I came up with the idea of listing names and then eventually it made sense to make a spreadsheet.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I want to be a better friend, brother, son, uncle, and everything.  I realized there are a lot of people I would love to reconnect with but I don't have their number in my new phone.  So I charged my old phone and added their numbers to the spreadsheet.  I texted an old friend and my sister and both were great.  The friend is making a meme app and I may try to make a meme creator website again, since my first one was pretty cool, but not user-friendly.
                </p>
                <p>
                    They say you can really only know 250 people.  Something about the sustainable size of a tribe we are evolved to keep track of.  I guess my goal of the spreadsheet would be to have 250 people I care about, and I'm on good terms with.  I had a robust circle of friends during highschool and it's been difficult for me to maintain that as I've gotten older.
                </p>
                <p>I'll be 30 in September.  That means no more excuses.  No more young and stupid.  No more fucking around.  I'm going to try to have a good life, and ignore unimportant distractions.  You have to understand, there are so many companies vying for your attention.  It's hard to get through the day!  The Social Dilemna Documentary does a great job of showing that.  And yes, I spelled Dilemna correctly, it's this reality that's incorrect, not me.</p>

                        The Truth about Truthers

                    <h3>02/09</h3>
                    <p>My two favorite voices I've found online are Jonathan Adampants and Quantum Conscience.</p>
                    <p>I believe these guys are the best and I'm going to try to explain why and what their messages have in common.  What they say is that conspiracy theorists are on the same level as everyone else.  They aren't better.  So even if you know something someone else does not know, if you obsess about it and let it consume you, what do you really know?  Nothing.  In fact, a lot of truth movements are fake and designed to suck you into a black hole with no clear answers or benefit to you.  Real truth has benefit.  It allows you to live your life better.  That's what these guys are about.  "Stop chasing the rabbit, put your rifle down" is what Quantum Conscience says.  Adampants says you have the "awake" people and they are just another category of people programmed by society.

                        The purpose of this site
                    </h2>
                    <h3>02/06/21</h3>
                    <p>
                        It might seem like the purpose of this site is to convince you not to take the vaccine or to believe in conspiracy theories.  It's not.  I think that's just what's on here right now because it's something I have trouble sharing with people in real life and I had it pent up and just put it all here first thing.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        One of the main reasons for this website is to practice coding.  It's a skill I learned that I want to continue to grow.  I miss coding when I stop doing it.  I like this site because it's like a very basic foundation designed to be a skeleton I can build on.  
                    </p>
                    <p>Another purpose of this website is to show off my life's work.  I have call of duty montages, chess ratings, an album of original music.  I have photoshop art, a poem and a story.  I have an essay, and my education and credentials.  It's not just to show off, it's more like I'm organizing everything I've ever done so I can see what I want to work on and what I can leave alone.</p>
        
                    <p>I also want to be able to share my thoughts on entertainment with reviews.  I also want to share my strategy with competitive video games because I'm usually very successful in online gaming once I discover a winning strategy.</p>
        
                    <p>In Call of Duty Cold war I use a silenced Ak74u and a Sniper rifle with ghost ninja and spycraft.  It enables you to play comfortably because no one ever sees you coming and you always have an advantage at any range because the sniper dominates long range and the ak74u can handle anything else.  But that's far from my best online strategy.  I was completely unstoppable in MW3 with a Type 95 and a pp90.  Basically in COD you want to have 2 weapons and pick your battles carefully.</p>
        
                    <p>
                        In Gears of War 3 I would use 2 shotguns by starting with a sawed off, killing someone and grabbing their gnasher.  Then I'd run around with the sawed off and be able to switch to the gnasher instead of reloading the sawed off, and that strategy really does dominate, but the game is outdated.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I miss Halo.  What a great game that was, but I prefer playstation.  God of War and The Last of Us 1 and 2 are so unbelievably good it's just astounding.  And Spiderman is fun to swing around in for sure. I loved Gears and Halo 3 but the sequels were getting progressively worse, so I switched to Playstation 4 for the superior single player experience.
                    </p>
                    <p>What do I hope to accomplish with this site? Well, it's like therapy to me.  It's like a rubber band ball; I keep adding to it and eventually it can bounce.  I always feel like it's time well spent when I code this because it keeps my skills fresh.  I also have an outlet to put my ideas out into the world without the politics of facebook.  
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        So ya, this site is multipurpose.  I'm kind of just seeing what I can do.  I'm saying to the world, here I am.  This is all me.  I made this.  Here's everything I've ever done and am doing.  Take it or leave it.

Then I started to see the real Russell Brand talking on youtube.  I found him to be pretentious, but I think now he's gotten a lot better at his delivery.  I think he's not just some actor spouting philsophy, he's actually gotten a lot of practice delving into complicated ideas that I think he's quite good now.</p>

                    <p>
                        I can't go to the movies.
        </p><p>
        There is a sign posted outside the local movie theater.
        </p><p>
        It says, "We are closed until local and state government guidelines allow us to reopen."
        </p><p>
        Translation: this private company would like to be open, but your governor has forbid us to be open.  He has taken away your right to go to the movies, and our right to provide them to you.
        </p><p>
        Guidelines.  They call them guidelines.  They are not.  They are dictates.  They are unlawful.  They are an infringement on our rights. 
        </p><p>
        Now I went to the theater and saw Tenet the moment it opened.  There were ridiculous rules like wearing mask at all times and having employees get you drinks in a separate section, but it was still enjoyable, to be free.  Even that wasn't good enough for them.  They had to shut it down for what?  For my safety?  Or for total control of what the population can or cannot do with their free will?
        </p><p>
        It is disgusting that these governors can prevent us from going to the movies in the name of public safety. It's a joke.  It's a scam.  It's a lie. If they care about health then why are we able to buy alcohol and tobacco?
        </p><p>
        They only care about control.  Dominion.
