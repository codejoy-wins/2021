                This is a cool talk where this guys quotes Immanuel Kant and discusses the conscience of right and wrong.
            </p>
            <p>He also has a brilliant theory that we're all dead and trapped in some sort of layer of hell where only some of us can see what's going on.</p>

                The purpose of this site
            </h2>
            <h3>02/06/21</h3>
            <p>
                It might seem like the purpose of this site is to convince you not to take the vaccine or to believe in conspiracy theories.  It's not.  I think that's just what's on here right now because it's something I have trouble sharing with people in real life and I had it pent up and just put it all here first thing.
            </p>
            <p>
                One of the main reasons for this website is to practice coding.  It's a skill I learned that I want to continue to grow.  I miss coding when I stop doing it.  I like this site because it's like a very basic foundation designed to be a skeleton I can build on.  
            </p>
            <p>Another purpose of this website is to show off my life's work.  I have call of duty montages, chess ratings, an album of original music.  I have photoshop art, a poem and a story.  I have an essay, and my education and credentials.  It's not just to show off, it's more like I'm organizing everything I've ever done so I can see what I want to work on and what I can leave alone.</p>

            <p>I also want to be able to share my thoughts on entertainment with reviews.  I also want to share my strategy with competitive video games because I'm usually very successful in online gaming once I discover a winning strategy.</p>

            <p>In Call of Duty Cold war I use a silenced Ak74u and a Sniper rifle with ghost ninja and spycraft.  It enables you to play comfortably because no one ever sees you coming and you always have an advantage at any range because the sniper dominates long range and the ak74u can handle anything else.  But that's far from my best online strategy.  I was completely unstoppable in MW3 with a Type 95 and a pp90.  Basically in COD you want to have 2 weapons and pick your battles carefully.</p>

            <p>
                In Gears of War 3 I would use 2 shotguns by starting with a sawed off, killing someone and grabbing their gnasher.  Then I'd run around with the sawed off and be able to switch to the gnasher instead of reloading the sawed off, and that strategy really does dominate, but the game is outdated.
            </p>
            <p>
                I miss Halo.  What a great game that was, but I prefer playstation.  God of War and The Last of Us 1 and 2 are so unbelievably good it's just astounding.  And Spiderman is fun to swing around in for sure. I loved Gears and Halo 3 but the sequels were getting progressively worse, so I switched to Playstation 4 for the superior single player experience.
            </p>
            <p>What do I hope to accomplish with this site? Well, it's like therapy to me.  It's like a rubber band ball; I keep adding to it and eventually it can bounce.  I always feel like it's time well spent when I code this because it keeps my skills fresh.  I also have an outlet to put my ideas out into the world without the politics of facebook.  
            </p>
            <p>
                So ya, this site is multipurpose.  I'm kind of just seeing what I can do.  I'm saying to the world, here I am.  This is all me.  I made this.  Here's everything I've ever done and am doing.  Take it or leave it.  
            </p>

            <p>Thank you, Russell Brand.  My first impression of Russell Brand was when he was Aldus Snow in Forgetting Sarah Marshall.  He made that movie and was an instant sensation.  Then I started to see the real Russell Brand talking on youtube.  I found him to be pretentious, but I think now he's gotten a lot better at his delivery.  I think he's not just some actor spouting philsophy, he's actually gotten a lot of practice delving into complicated ideas that I think he's quite good now.</p>  

            <p>It's like a breath of fresh air to hear someone prominent talk about the dangers we're facing.</p>

            <h2>Guidelines</h2>
            <h3>01/20/21</h3>
            <p>
                I can't go to the movies.
</p><p>
There is a sign posted outside the local movie theater.
</p><p>
It says, "We are closed until local and state government guidelines allow us to reopen."
</p><p>
Translation: this private company would like to be open, but your governor has forbid us to be open.  He has taken away your right to go to the movies, and our right to provide them to you.
</p><p>
Guidelines.  They call them guidelines.  They are not.  They are dictates.  They are unlawful.  They are an infringement on our rights. 
</p><p>
Now I went to the theater and saw Tenet the moment it opened.  There were ridiculous rules like wearing mask at all times and having employees get you drinks in a separate section, but it was still enjoyable, to be free.  Even that wasn't good enough for them.  They had to shut it down for what?  For my safety?  Or for total control of what the population can or cannot do with their free will?
</p><p>
It is disgusting that these governors can prevent us from going to the movies in the name of public safety. It's a joke.  It's a scam.  It's a lie. If they care about health then why are we able to buy alcohol and tobacco?
</p><p>
They only care about control.  Dominion.
