            <h2>Torture Chamber</h2>
            <h3>12/13/21</h3>
            <p>My coworker tells me to look on the bright side.  My best friend tells me to stop blaming the government for my own unhappiness. In this post, I'm going to share when I was unhappy, and how that's no longer the case.  I'm going to try to explain the difference between personal unhappiness, and environmental unhappiness.
            </p>
            <p>
                I have been unhappy before.  I have sufferered daily with severe anxiety for years at a time.  I know what Hell on Earth is.  I also know what Heaven on Earth is.  Heaven was when I was in love with my highschool sweetheart, through the first year of college.  Hell is what happened shortly after I moved off campus during my sophomore year, and my girlfriend broke up with me and wouldn't visit.  
            </p>
            <p>
                I tried to get her back, but I knew I couldn't visit her at her school, and she wouldn't visit me, so I tried to get her back through writing songs, texts, and emails.  This was a hopeless endeavor. By focusing on how I appeared through digital long distance, I let my physical self go.  It wasn't like I could gel my hair and knock on her door.  I let that part of myself go.  
            </p>
            <p>
                I was so sad that when I wasn't writing love songs I was trying to forget about it by playing call of duty and smoking marijuana.  I would skip class because it was too much of a shock to suddenly be on campus surrounded by hundreds of people when I had been alone in my room for so long leading up to it.  I started getting terrible anxiety from all the weed and isolation.
            </p>
            <p>
                I eventually developed Paruresis which is a condition where you have a shy bladder and can't urninate in public, except mine was so bad, I basically couldn't urinate at home if other people were there.  I was feeling very inadequate with not having a girlfriend anymore too so I was feeling very insecure and was just destroyed by Paruresis.  It got so bad it became my main reason for skipping class until I failed out of UCSC and came back home.
            </p>
            <p>
                I was so embarrassed I couldn't tell anyone what I was going through.  Finally I told my Mom.  Eventaully I was telling my Dad, and my best friends.  Now, I'm telling the world.  Honestly it doesn't matter to me anymore, and the more people you tell the less serious it becomes.  I don't suffer from anxiety anymore.  I don't live in a personal hell.  In those days, I could have been at a concert at UCSC with a beautiful ocean view and beautiful girls dancing and I would have been having a terrible time and thinking about going to the bathroom.  I would go to the bathroom, lock the door, try and fail to pee, and then go back out, then try again in 5 minutes.  It was painful and horrible.  I wouldn't drink anything in public, because I didn't like having to use the restroom in public, so I was dehydrated.  That is how I define personal unhappiness. Regardless of my environment, I was unhappy.
            </p>
            <p>
                Eventually I came home, told some people, read a book about OCD called Brain Lock, and then gradually got over the problem.  I went to Moorpark College to get good grades to get back into UCSC.  I eventually overcame my anxiety and graduated from UCSC with a cute girlfriend. 
                My personal Hell was over, and has been over since.  I know the tricks of how to deal with anxiety or depression (without meds) and my personal hell is so far away it's hard to believe that was the same person. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Now, I want to talk about environmental hell.  In Man's Search for Meaning, Victor Frankl tells a story of his experience in a concentration camp.  I'm not in one of those, but my point is that he had his mind right, but he was in environmental hell.  No one would blame Victor Frankl for saying something negative about his environment.  They wouldn't claim he was blaming the Nazi's for his own personal hell.  It really was hell closing in on him, and he would have to be blind not to see it and be bothered by it.
            </p>
            <p>
                So what kind of environmental hell am I claiming to be in?  Well, how about America today?  Let me explain, because it's very nuanced.  I'm not talking about America today for the average person.  No, the average person is completely oblivous to what I'm going through.
            </p>
            <p>
                So what am I going through?  Well first, let me tell you a story of Ignaz Semmelweis.  This man set out to solve the problem of babies and mothers dying at an alarming rate.
            </p>
            <p>
                Eventually he figured out, and proved to himself, that doctors were touching dead bodies and then delivering babies without washing their hands in between.  He didn't know the exact mechanism of the germs but he knew washing hands before delivering the babies would dramatically reduce the death rates of mothers and their newborn children.  
            </p>
            <p>
                At the time, doctors laughed at him and his theories, because there was no publicly accepted theory of germs at the time.
            </p>
            <p>
                This put Ignaz Semmelweis into an environmental hell.  It wasn't a personal hell.  He would be fine if they listened to him and the babies were saved.  It was an environmental hell because he was unable to convince anyone, or save any babies.
            </p>
            <p> This drove him insane.  He called the doctors, "Murderers" and ended up in a mental institution.</p>
            <p>History has proven him right, but his environment never did.</p>

            <p>
                What I'm going through, my personal struggle, is virtually identical to that.  My balance, is how do I accomplish what I wish to accomplish without going insane?  That is my dance.  That is my greatest challenge. 
            </p>
            <p>
                So what do I know that you don't?  Who is dying?  How can I save them?  What do I want to convince you of so badly that's it's already literally driven me insane??
            </p>
            <p>
                I cannot tell you.  You lack the patience.  I'm just trying to at least establish the fact that I am in a torture chamber called America Today.  I am in environmental hell.
            </p>

                This is so far beyond genius I am speechless

            </div>
            <p>
                Matt analyzes Groundhog day and talks about Bill Murray's journey from trying to exploit his situation, to attempting suicide, to saving people.  It's such a brilliant analysis I'm just at a loss for words...  
            </p>
            <p>There's really nothing to say.  I don't want this to be a quantum video every time but when he puts out pure gold what can you do.  I figured out one other common theme between him and Adampants.  They both speak to the act of saving another life, not for a reward, but for yourself.  Like Bill Murray has the power to save the kid's life falling out of the tree, and he knows he's not going to be thanked, he believes he's trapped in this day forever, and he still helps the kid.  Adampants talks about saving someone from drowning and what the reward would be.  He has this great line, "you get to heaven and God says here is your reward, you open the box, what's in there?" The point is that saving the person is the reward; anything else is trivial.  Adampants is the only truth I've found other than the occasional parable from Jesus.  We are so lucky to have this quantum of conscience guy creating content right now. It's just such a rare perspective and it's so close to the truth I can see the magnetism in the air.</p>
            <h2>
                People, Time, and Spreadsheets
            </h2>
            <h3>02/10/21</h3>
            <p>
                Have you ever felt like there wasn't enough time in a day?  I've dealt with that problem a lot but now I'm making an active effort to shut out distractions and focus on what's truly important.
            </p>
            <p>
                I decided to make a spreadsheet of all the people I care about.  I have categories of people like family, extended family, friends, girls, men, and women.  Then I have a column for phone number, for their birthday, and when they last communicated with me, what they said, and what kind of terms we're on.  
            </p>
            <p>I'm probably not the first person to make a spreadsheet for their personal life outside of work for friends and family but I like the idea of running my life like a business, in a good way.</p>

            <p>
                I have my PS4 using youtube to play a video of rain hitting the ground.  It's very soothing.  And then I just laid down and thought about what I really wanted to do.  Free of distractions.  No ads, no lyrics, just free time to think.  That was when I came up with the idea of listing names and then eventually it made sense to make a spreadsheet.
            </p>
            <p>
                I want to be a better friend, brother, son, uncle, and everything.  I realized there are a lot of people I would love to reconnect with but I don't have their number in my new phone.  So I charged my old phone and added their numbers to the spreadsheet.  I texted an old friend and my sister and both were great.  The friend is making a meme app and I may try to make a meme creator website again, since my first one was pretty cool, but not user-friendly.
            </p>
            <p>
                They say you can really only know 250 people.  Something about the sustainable size of a tribe we are evolved to keep track of.  I guess my goal of the spreadsheet would be to have 250 people I care about, and I'm on good terms with.  I had a robust circle of friends during highschool and it's been difficult for me to maintain that as I've gotten older.
            </p>
            <p>I'll be 30 in September.  That means no more excuses.  No more young and stupid.  No more fucking around.  I'm going to try to have a good life, and ignore unimportant distractions.  You have to understand, there are so many companies vying for your attention.  It's hard to get through the day!  The Social Dilemna Documentary does a great job of showing that.  And yes, I spelled Dilemna correctly, it's this reality that's incorrect, not me.</p>

                The Truth about Truthers
            </h2>
            <h3>02/09</h3>
            <p>My two favorite voices I've found online are Jonathan Adampants and Quantum Conscious.</p>
            <p>I believe these guys are the best and I'm going to try to explain why and what their messages have in common.  What they say is that conspiracy theorists are on the same level as everyone else.  They aren't better.  So even if you know something someone else does not know, if you obsess about it and let it consume you, what do you really know?  Nothing.  In fact, a lot of truth movements are fake and designed to suck you into a black hole with no clear answers or benefit to you.  Real truth has benefit.  It allows you to live your life better.  That's what these guys are about.  "Stop chasing the rabbit, put your rifle down" is what Quantum Conscious says.  Adampants says you have the "awake" people and they are just another category of people programmed by society.  He says if you magnetically bond to a conspiracy theory now you're way off your path, and when I heard that it really helped me regain some of myself.    </p>
            <p>The common theme between them is that you have to stop looking outside of yourself for answers.  Truth comes from within.</p>

            <h2>
                The purpose of this site
            </h2>
            <h3>02/06/21</h3>
            <p>
                It might seem like the purpose of this site is to convince you not to take the vaccine or to believe in conspiracy theories.  It's not.  I think that's just what's on here right now because it's something I have trouble sharing with people in real life and I had it pent up and just put it all here first thing.
            </p>
            <p>
                One of the main reasons for this website is to practice coding.  It's a skill I learned that I want to continue to grow.  I miss coding when I stop doing it.  I like this site because it's like a very basic foundation designed to be a skeleton I can build on.  
            </p>
            <p>Another purpose of this website is to show off my life's work.  I have call of duty montages, chess ratings, an album of original music.  I have photoshop art, a poem and a story.  I have an essay, and my education and credentials.  It's not just to show off, it's more like I'm organizing everything I've ever done so I can see what I want to work on and what I can leave alone.</p>

            <p>I also want to be able to share my thoughts on entertainment with reviews.  I also want to share my strategy with competitive video games because I'm usually very successful in online gaming once I discover a winning strategy.</p>

            <p>In Call of Duty Cold war I use a silenced Ak74u and a Sniper rifle with ghost ninja and spycraft.  It enables you to play comfortably because no one ever sees you coming and you always have an advantage at any range because the sniper dominates long range and the ak74u can handle anything else.  But that's far from my best online strategy.  I was completely unstoppable in MW3 with a Type 95 and a pp90.  Basically in COD you want to have 2 weapons and pick your battles carefully.</p>

            <p>
                In Gears of War 3 I would use 2 shotguns by starting with a sawed off, killing someone and grabbing their gnasher.  Then I'd run around with the sawed off and be able to switch to the gnasher instead of reloading the sawed off, and that strategy really does dominate, but the game is outdated.
            </p>
            <p>
                I miss Halo.  What a great game that was, but I prefer playstation.  God of War and The Last of Us 1 and 2 are so unbelievably good it's just astounding.  And Spiderman is fun to swing around in for sure. I loved Gears and Halo 3 but the sequels were getting progressively worse, so I switched to Playstation 4 for the superior single player experience.
            </p>
            <p>What do I hope to accomplish with this site? Well, it's like therapy to me.  It's like a rubber band ball; I keep adding to it and eventually it can bounce.  I always feel like it's time well spent when I code this because it keeps my skills fresh.  I also have an outlet to put my ideas out into the world without the politics of facebook.  
            </p>
            <p>
                So ya, this site is multipurpose.  I'm kind of just seeing what I can do.  I'm saying to the world, here I am.  This is all me.  I made this.  Here's everything I've ever done and am doing.  Take it or leave it.  
            </p>

                My friend just turned me onto this channel and I watched a few of his videos and he has some really interesting points about reality.
            </p>
            <p>
                His latest video talks about the ridiculous nba salaries and how they don't make sense with a full year of no fans buying tickets.

                This was the first video where I heard Jonathan Adampants.  Later on I decided I wanted to hear more and discovered his full videos.  This is just a provacative montage.  This video is no longer allowed on youtube, so you know it's good.  Enjoy.

            <p>Thank you, Russell Brand.  My first impression of Russell Brand was when he was Aldus Snow in Forgetting Sarah Marshall.  He made that movie and was an instant sensation.  Then I started to see the real Russell Brand talking on youtube.  I found him to be pretentious, but I think now he's gotten a lot better at his delivery.  I think he's not just some actor spouting philsophy, he's actually gotten a lot of practice delving into complicated ideas that I think he's quite good now.</p>  

            <p>It's like a breath of fresh air to hear someone prominent talk about the dangers we're facing.</p>

            <h2>Guidelines</h2>
            <h3>01/20/21</h3>
            <p>
                I can't go to the movies.
</p><p>
There is a sign posted outside the local movie theater.
</p><p>
It says, "We are closed until local and state government guidelines allow us to reopen."
</p><p>
Translation: this private company would like to be open, but your governor has forbid us to be open.  He has taken away your right to go to the movies, and our right to provide them to you.
</p><p>
Guidelines.  They call them guidelines.  They are not.  They are dictates.  They are unlawful.  They are an infringement on our rights. 
</p><p>
Now I went to the theater and saw Tenet the moment it opened.  There were ridiculous rules like wearing mask at all times and having employees get you drinks in a separate section, but it was still enjoyable, to be free.  Even that wasn't good enough for them.  They had to shut it down for what?  For my safety?  Or for total control of what the population can or cannot do with their free will?
</p><p>
It is disgusting that these governors can prevent us from going to the movies in the name of public safety. It's a joke.  It's a scam.  It's a lie. If they care about health then why are we able to buy alcohol and tobacco?
</p><p>
They only care about control.  Dominion.
