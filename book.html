                </p><p>

                    "Mr. Anderson!"  Agent smith repeatedly says to Neo in the Matrix.  Why?  Smith was antagonizing Neo, trying to get him to identify with his Matrix name, because he was the God of the Matrix simulation, and as long as Neo plays by the rules of the Matrix, he'll lose.  Agent smith has Neo in a chokehold on the traintracks as a train approaches.  How does Neo win?  He loosens the chokehold just enough to be able to say, "My name is Neo!" and then he rises up and slams Smith into the ceiling before blackflipping out of the way just as the train comes and hits Agent Smith.  Neo is an anagram for "One" and Neo was the one.  Elam is an anagram for "Male" and I am the alpha male.  I'm here to teach you how to loosen the devil's chokehold just enough for you to be able to take a breath and tell him who you really are.  You are God's children, and he can't prevent you from getting closer to your heavenly father.  All he can do is try.

                        I am a White Blood Cell.  I detect an illness in the body we're a part of and I intend to engulf that illness with love and to sacrifice myself for the good of the body.  This book will not make you more like me.  It will make you more like you.  Statistically, if you're reading this, you are probably a Red Blood Cell.  RBCs are equally as valuable to the body as WBCs, as they carry blood to and from the heart to keep the body alive.  White Blood Cells need to move quickly and recent 3D imaging has shown they do this by shapeshifting until they reach the site of the infection.   The white blood cell does not waste time trying to get the red blood cells to see the disease, nor does it try to convince them to get out of the way.  Instead, the WBC takes whatever shape it needs to on the way to get the job done.  I will do whatever I have to do, and be whoever I have to be, to get my job done.

                        What is the illness I seek to heal?  More important than that is the cure.  The cure is openmindedness.  If I say, "Jesus", some of you will immediately close this book. But Jesus wasn't a Christian.  Jesus was a man.  Religions based on that man's life that have turned you off are not his fault.  I need to be able to quote scripture in this book to provoke thought, but without the heavy attachment of the churches I disevow.  Jesus didn't have a Jesus.  He had a personal connection with his Creator, the Creator, and did His will, and was able to accomplish great things.  We can use the example of Jesus to better connect with our own Creator, and that is our only defense against the Devil and the greatest trick he ever pulled.

                        Nietzche's critique of Christianity is the most brilliant one of all time in the book "Beyond Good and Evil".  I will attempt to explain it, and then turn it against itself.

                    Explaining It

                    He argues that there was originally a natural morality where man saw things as good or bad, and made his own judgments.  Good or bad the way someone is good or bad at basketball.  Kobe Bryant is good at basketball, in that sense.  But then a new type of morality developed.  Nietzche called this new morality the "slave morality", and he called the old morality "master morality".  See, the master, can get whatever he wants, and calls himself good at getting what he wants, like the slave's wife if he wants, or the bigger share of dinner.  But the slave cannot get what he wants.  His will to power is suppressed.  He can't keep his wife, and he can't hunt as well, or get the best part of the calf.  Nietzche argues that his suppressed will to power finds a way out by inventing a new type of morality of good and evil.  Suddenly, the master isn't good, he's evil in the new slave morality.  The slave tells himself,  "I would respect my slaves wife if I was that strong, and I would share my meals and let my slave be free."  People often associate "bad" with "evil", but if you go back to the basketball example.  The most likely player you're going to call "Evil" would be Lebron James on the Heat dunking on people.   Lebron james is so good that if you were playing against him and he never let you score and dunked on you every single time you might think he was evil, or a bad person.  A good person or a bad person in today's language often refers to the slave morality definitions of good and bad, and how well you treat others as opposed to how good you are at winning.  In the game of life, the Lebron's keep dunking, and we tend to call them evil, when they used to be considered good.  Christianity, in that sense, has a slave morality, because it tells people the meek will inherit the Earth, or that the poor are blessed.  It speaks of Heaven and how the rich won't get in.  It appealed to literal slaves who believed that they were righeous not to fight back and to turn the other cheek.  Christianity gives the powerless power.  It gives victims moral superiority.  It condemns evil.  It helps the incel feel pure when really he just can't get laid.  It helps the married man feel like a better person than Tiger woods when he cheats on his wife with the bus full of supermodels waiting for him to finish golfing.  Is your morality really your own morality?  Or is it your will to power satisfying itself in a roundabout way?

                    Turning it against itself
                </p><p>
                    
                    Lucifer, God's favorite angel, uses this master morality to try to say that "Goodness" is just weakness in disguise.  The devil argues that if man were given power, he would abuse it.  "Do what thou wilt" is a Satanic matra, and embraces the master morality argument of discounting traditional ideas of good and evil and instead just going after what you want and you are either good or bad at that.  Lucifer is the light-bringer.  He calls himself light and views himself as exposing the darkness that is the slave morality of Christianity.  The Irony is that Lucifer lost his war in Heaven.  Lucifer is a loser who had his will to power suppressed in heaven by Archangel Michael who defeated him in battle even though Lucifer turned himself into a dragon.  Rather than accepting that he is bad and God is Good, after losing the war with God without God even lifting a finger, Lucifer declares himself Good.  He tries to get humans to see him as the bringer of truth, the light bearer, when really his is the Father of lies.  Lucifer's master morality is actually the slave morality of heaven.  The light of the world is Jesus.  The truth is that God is Good, and Jesus is the light he shined on the world on how to be good.  Lucifer, is actually dark, but calls himself light for the same reason the slave calls himself good when he is actually bad.

                </p><p>
                    
                        Jesus Christ is the Son of God.  He is the light of the world.  If we are judged it is because we preferred darkness because our deeds were evil.  We have to repent and embrace the light and only then will we be available to hear anything that is true.  If we have ears to hear, and eyes to see,  The truth will set us free.  And once we all link up to truth and love and Jesus and our Creator, we will be more powerful than even the Dragon.  I am Elam the Dragonslayer, and you are destined for greatness, but you have the free will to falter.  But no matter how far you have fallen, or sinned, which is an archery term for "missing the mark", if you are alive, you still have a chance to join God's team.  And let me tell you, when you're on God's team, you're going to win -- forever.

                        Some of you may have wondered why my chapters seem to jump all over the place and skip.  Others of you may have already figured it out.  It's binary code for 1,2,3,4,5. Chapter 101 is 5 because the 1's represent on switches and the 0's are off switches for the powers of two.  The rightmost 1 is for 2^0 being on.  The leftmost 1 is for 2^2 being on.  2^0 = 1 and 2^2 is 4 so 4+1=5.   2^1 is switched off with a zero, so we wouldn't add 2^1= 2.  If we did have it on it would be Chapter 111 and mean chapter 7.  Even binary numbers always end in 0 because it's all powers of two being added to each other and the final digit is whether or not to add one for the odd numbers.

                        I hope this lesson shows you that some things that seem foolish are actually complexly accuracte if you have the proper education.  I went to a coding bootcamp and learning how to do web development.  I went to UCSC and learned how to do philosophy.  I taught myself how to design games.  I have been interviewed at Google, Amazon, and Meta but I've never gotten the job.  I am not sure computer programming is for me, but I'm glad I know enough to be able to code my own website, maxjann.com, and write a philosophical blog.  The girl I'm seeing told me I should write a book and this is that book.  A cute 19 yearold girl thought you should have this.   Before I get into the crux of my book about what I think is going on the world, and how you can arm yourself against it, I will share a little bit more about my background.  In highschool I dated a girl who won the award for "Dream Date".   That means that when everyone thought about who they most wanted to go out with, they all thought of my girlfriend.  I was living the dream.  No doubt, I was, and loving every second of it.  But I believe dating her through highschool and college was key to me developing a belief in myself, that my own methods get results better than following anyone elses.  It also allowed me to stop playing the dating game and start figuring out what the truth of this place really is.  Some people are still chasing that perfect girl, with their head down hard at work,  I was lucky enough to be able to get her early, live my dream, and realize that there's more to life than having a good reputation.  I don't mean to brag, what I mean to do is qualify myself as the alpha male, so you can learn from the lessons only I can teach.  
                        It doesn't mean I'm more valuable than you.  Who am I to say who God values most?  All I can do is what I think God created me for.  He created me to glorify himself, and any glory I bring on myself in attempt to bring God glory is forgiven. What I can say is that one of the people with the highest IQ's ever, Richard Rosner, went to highschool multiple times and changed his identity each time, because he viewed highchool as a microcosm of life.  In that microcosm of my life, I was sexually chosen by the girl most guys wanted to date, which is a yearbook fact.  I am the guy who gets the girl; I don't have to do it over and over again to understand that about myself.   I am the alpha male of Westlake High School, class of 2010. 
                        Someone has to be the first pick of the draft, and score the most points.  I've done both of those things in youth basketball. It's that person's responsibility to share their unique perspective with the tribe because life is a team sport.  I want us to win.  I'm not trying to trick you for my own benefit, I'm trying to get you to see the trick at my own expense.  You might think you are a better man than me, and more alpha.  You might have a hotter girl and a better life and do more good in the world.  You might be right, but most men live quiet lives of desperation, and I'm trying to save them, and I could use your help.
                </p><p>
                    
                    In the movies about highschool they always had the buff jock who had the girl and then the nerdy nice guy who ends up with the girl.  I decided to do both.  I attacked from every angle, and had no weakness.  I had big arms, a big brain, was nice, could play football, and chess.  She had no choice, no chance, but to accept my advances, and I even formulated a strategy of how to get her, which was to outcompete all other men.  I figured when I became a senior there would be no guys older than me and I was confident I could outcompete everyone in my grade level.  So I used my Junior year to plan for my senior year girlfriend.  I made myself irresistible and the logical choice.  If love is a game, I had the best game.  The guy I looked up to the most when it came to women told me one day that I had surpassed even him and that was when I knew I had a unique perspective to share.  At that point it's between you and God.  When Gary Kasparov was so good at chess that no person could beat him, and they made a computer that was better than everyone else and it still couldn't beat Gary, chess was between Gary and God.  God is the creator, and has the ultimate knowledge of everything.  Every beautiful thing you experience, he put there for you to discover.  And the experts in their fields are alone with God.  God is always there.  Getting better at something only brings you closer to God, who is the best at everything.

                        I know who I am.  I am Elam Aplha, the alpha male.  I don't need to prove it to others anymore.  Someone has to be, I just am.  It isn't Elon Musk, it's me.  It's not Elon; it's Elam.  He's a fraud, I'm real.

                        What's happening in the world is we are being pushed in a certain planned direction by the events that seem to happen randomly.  The official story is that we were attacked on 9/11 and had to respond the way we did.  We were blindsided by this coronavirus and had to shutdown the world and inject people with mRNA technology.  That's not the way the world actually works.
                </p><p>
                    
                    The problems we think we face are not real.  They are orchestrated.  Then they induce a fear reaction from the public.  The solutions are presented to us as the only option and we agree to go along with them and give up some of our freedoms, tax dollars, or privacy.  This is a systematic attack on you specifically, and you need to wake up.  My job is to wake you up so we can win.  We are running out of time.  What we need, is a breakaway civilization, with new laws and new news and new everything.  Then we need to do a basic experiment and see which civilization does better, the new one I call Cloudland, or the old.  Because increasingly the power of this world is a global force of totalitarian takeover.  We must escape it and declare our independence if we want to keep our values intact.

                    The bad guys of this movie are the ones that created the virus with gain of function research.  They planned out the vaccine ahead of time and injected most of us.  Any sermon that doesn't warn you against this vaccine or doing what the government tells you to do or believe is worthless.  I am here to warn you.  I'm hear to save you.  I'm going to be as loud as I possibly can until it kills me, and the disease at the same time.

                    Remember to keep an open mind.  Jesus says the devil would deceiveth the whole world.  Regardless of what shape the earth is, hypothetically, if it was flat, that would illustrate the depth of the lies here and how skilled Satan is at tricking you.  The covid virus has never been isolated.  The inventor of the PCR test said not to use it to diagnose viral infections.  The inventor of the mRNA technology said not to get the vax.  The media is full of shit on every single channel.  Even the truth channels, are flooded with fake truth to poison the well.  The social networks are policed and our ability to think and discuss has been damaged.  Misinformation campaigns are excuses to police free thought and keep your mind in a tiny box.  Google is there to spoonfeed you politically correct answers.  I think Google's search engine is a wonderful tool, but these are precarious times for our minds and we are at war.  It's a spritual war, a mind war, an invisible war, and a secret war.  We blew up ourselves on 9/11.  It's called a False Flag where we blame someone else so we can attack them with public support.  We lied.  Satan is responsible.  He can slip in and out of people like how any person not unplugged from the Matrix can become an agent.  You better start believing in ghost stories, Elizabeth; you're in one.

                        I would like to work full-time on my cause, and by buying the Book of Elam you are part of the revolution.  You are part of the rebellion we so desperately need.  You are the resistance.  I will form a church and make it cool.  I will form a civilization and make it thrive.  I will form an army and make it win.  Now I should say, that our current civilization is not without merit.  It does a lot of things right.  We are still largely able to get educated, get a job, get a girl, and make a family.  Some men are succeeding here.  But the stats don't lie.  Most of us are clinically depressed, anxious, addicted, or suicidal.  Why?  Well something's missing.  We're all capable of happiness. We have the technology to build a new world where happiness is easier to come by, and you're allowed to live in a little house for free while you figure out how you want to contribute.  We could fix hunger, be sustainable, it's all doable.  It's all worth striving for.  But right now we have this capitalistic net of self-interest, barely holding everything together.  We frantically drive around in traffic, trying to buy shit we don't need to impress people we don't like, like Tyler Durden said in Fight Club.  I am your Tyler Durden.  We can start a project mayhem but instead of mayhem we can be creative.  Project Creator.  Where we honor our creator and pay homage to Him in everything we do, that way we can succeed like Jesus succeeded.

                    We can do this.  We can come up with a better system.  I can lead us there if you let me.  It starts by being honest with each other about how we feel.  It starts by reconnecting to our spirit, like the youtube philosopher Jonathan Adampants said.  He's the John the Baptist to my Elam.

                        In our society we attack like dogs when someone thinks differently, or speaks controversially.  Look at Kyrie Irving and Kanye West.  I want to make a Kyrie Irving highlight montage with Kanye West music.  It will be great because Kyrie can ball with the best of them and Kanye can rap with them too.  It's between Kyrie and God when it comes to handles and finishing at the rim against Golden State.  It's between Kanye and God when he's writing Runaway, Jesus Walks, or Ultralight Beam.

                        Antisemitism is used as a tactic to prevent thought and pointing the finger at where harm might be done.  I bet when I called myself and Alpha male you wanted to disprove me, or challenge me rather than learn from me, but guess what?  You're a maxist.  You're only doing that because my name is Max, and you're no better than those hate crimes that were commited to little boys named Max, so speak no further and apologize and pay this fine.

                        We need to be able to talk.  Talking leads to the truth and the truth leads to Jesus Christ and your Creator.  They restrict speech, and thought, and they do it under the guise of what's best for you.  You should be humiliated that the government feels they have to censor information for you that might be untrue because you're too stupid to figure it out for yourself.  They say they are combating hate speech when really they are using that noble cause as an excuse to silence dissent.

                        I am not calling for violence against Jews, or Homosexuals, or blaming any group of people or condemning any action.  I am exposing these false justifications for silencing free speech.  They restrict your movement in the name of Covid.  They eliminate your bodily autonomy in the name of protecting others.  They go to war in the name of national security.  Every attack they wage is under the guise of benevolence, and we have to stop letting them get away with it.  They don't care.  The Committee of Public Safety in the French Revolution didn't care about public safety, it was just easier to chop peoples heads off with guillotines in the name of public safety.  Satan lies.  Does the rapist come up to you in the name of rape?  Or does he say he loves you before he slips something into your drink?  We have been raped by our own governments and need to file a police report.  And we can't call 911.  They will never help us.  911 is the number of 9/11 and that occult attack.  We need to call 117.  117 will dial our new police, Elam's secret police.  My police will be there to actually help people.  Our current police is there to uphold the law, and the law is rotten.  If you are a police officer know that I respect you and think there are good cops trying to do the right thing.  But you need to switch to my side, and realize you are working for the devil.  The police are used to protect the private property of the ones hoarding it.  This doesn't mean I'm against private property, or want Cloudland to be communist.  What I want is for us to admit that our current situation isn't perfect, is getting worse, and we need a new one.

                        Jordan Peterson warns us about Utopias and in a sense Cloudland could be viewed as a Utopia.  However I view it as a social experiment we need.  If Cloudland existed and we had something to compare this one world rat race to, people might switch sides.  They would try to step in, and spread false narratives about what goes on in Cloudland so they could invade for the benevolent cause of "Human Rights" but they will never say what they're really doing.  The Devil will use lies to suppress the truth.

                        All I'm asking for is a chance.  A chance to break free from this Matrix.  If I had money I'd be extremely dangerous to the establishment and I think they will prevent me from getting money.  I think they will prevent my words from getting out.  The published companies may not publish this.  We need a prince.  We need a leader.  A real one.  Not an old dying liar of a man like our President Joe Biden.  Not a smooth talker like Obama who seems like a great president but doesn't actually tell you what's going on.

                    Chapter 1000
                </p><p>
                    
                        There is a story of a knight who was training to become the best in his village.  He trained and trained, and when he walked home at the end of his hard work the pretty girls would wave at him and he would wave back.  Then one day a shadow approached him in his home.  The knight drew his sword but the shadow said, "I have come to offer you something".  The knight was then given a magical screen on which he could watch other knights training, the best in the world.  He became transfixed by the way they swung their swords and won their battles.  Then he came home another day and saw the shadow again and said, "What do you have to offer me this time?"  The shadow replied, "The most beautiful women in the world" and showed him images on the screen of very hot girls bathing and changing.  The knight started to miss his workouts, skip his training, and rush home to his screen to watch the knights save their town and the girls take off their clothes.  He stopped waving to the local girls in town.  He stopped leaving his room.  He stopped becoming a great knight.  Then one day the shadow appeared again and said, "I'm here to tell you the truth.  I am the Devil. It was prophesied that a young knight would defeat me and save his town, but now I have already won.  You have neglected your training and are no match for me."  The knight was shocked and defeated, and asked pathetically, "Can I see the women one more time?"  "Always." the Devil replied.  The devil doesn't care what he gives you as long as it's taking you away from the real war he's waging.  It's like when Cypher in the Matrix betrayed Morpheus by conspiring with Agent Smith to be put back into the Matrix as a famous actor with no memory of the real world.  The Agent happily agrees, because he doesn't care about the illusory experience of Cypher in the Fake Matrix.  He cares about winning the war of reality in the real world, trying to get to Zion, the last human city.

                        This world is a prison for your mind, and no matter how good you think you have it you have to realize that this isn't really real, and the devil doesn't care how much money you have or how successful you think you are, as long as it doesn't interfere with his spiritual war against God.  He will use anything and everything to tear you away from your Creator, to prove to God people prefer his way instead of God's way.   God and the Devil made a bet with Job in the Book of Job.  Job was a man who loved God and the Devil said that he only loves God because his life is good and if God took that away he would curse God.  God then took away Job's good life and Job famously said, "The Lord giveth and the Lord taketh away." and kept his faith in God.  God then showered him with an even better life than before and won the bet with the Devil.  We all have our own fight, and I'm trying to give you the weapons and armour you need to be victorious, so we can all be victorious one day with God in Heaven.  He is the only just ruler, and his Kingdom is the one to aim for.  Cloudland is just a stop-gap.  It's a step in the right direction, because I'm tired of being pushed in the wrong direction.  Stand up for what you believe in.  You've been told that Tolerance is a virtue, that you should be tolerant of other ways of life, and gay people making out in commercials.  That commercial for HIV meds isn't to sell medication.  It's to socially engineer the population and normalize homosexuality.  Intolerance is the virtue, because it allows you to stop the pain and do something about it.  Tolerance is only as good as the thing you're tolerating.  They're teaching us to be in pain, and do nothing about our pain.  Was Jesus tolerant of the money-lenders in church?  No, he wouldn't tolerate what bothered him in his father's house.  Did Jesus tolerate the religious leaders of his time, or did he defy them?  Obedience to God is disobedience to Earth.  You cannot serve two masters, God and money.

                        How did I come up with Elam?  Was it an original idea?  I was learning about the magical power of words.  
                </p><p>
                    
                    God created the world with words. In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. 
                </p><p>
                    
                    Satan uses words to trick us.  He hides things in reverse.  
                </p><p>
                    
                    So I decided to write a story with traditional values about a Dragonslayer.  I named the dragons the reverse of various things I was wrestling with like sexism, racism, toxic masculinity, and tolerance.  No one noticed.  I wanted to use that magic on the good side.  My character's name was Elam, but before I wrote the story of Cloudland, available on maxjann.com/story with illustrations, I came up with the concept of elam while playing around with words and trying to figure out what was happening to me.  See, in college I was in my car one night smoking weed and watching porn on my phone.  It was a sissy introduction video talking about how porn makes guys like dick, and that it's been turning me gay, or that I'd like to be a woman.  It used very hot women in the video and got me off more than I ever had to porn before.  I started to fall down the rabbit hole a little bit with sissy training videos telling me to worship cock.  I think this all started because I was attracted to girls reacting to big dicks and so I searched for cock worship videos and found the sissy stuff.  This scared me because it became sissy hypnosis and I was worried what the porn was doing to my brain and sexuality.  Then I saw a reverse sissy hypno video using the same magic but in the other direction.  It had pictures of very hot girls and was saying over and over, "Pretty girls are vying for my attention."  After watching that video at night, the very next day I had a different attitude towards women and approached a beautiful girl in the dining hall and asked her out.  She said yes and we eventually went out even though she didn't like that my favorite book was the bible.  She slept with me the first night and then wanted me to be her boyfriend but I had also recently asked out another girl and she had said yes.  It was a Friday, I fucked the other girl on Saturday and the first girl was upset but ultimately came back to me and I dated her because the second girl was not a good fit at all.  She was very petite and beautiful, and when I was fucking her in her dormroom one night she said, "Fuck me like I'm your little girl." and I proceeded to fuck her harder and faster than I ever have before or after.  "Fucker." she said to me as I fucked her brains out.  We didn't go any further into that fetish but it is one that I want to understand as a philosopher.  Why do girls say "Daddy" in bed and why did what she said work for me?  Is it because in the past men had sex with their daughters and that's why they hand them off to the husband when they get married?  I don't know.  Is every father and daughter now sexually repressed in our society?  I am not sure.  I don't have a daughter.  But I think our society is too sexually repressed and we need to get to the bottom of these things, talk about them, and make people happy again.  If you want to have gay sex I don't think that makes you a bad person, I just don't want you to kiss your boyfriend in front of me if your a guy.  I think there are more important things to worry about and fix.  If someone is born gay than by all means be who God created you to be.  I'm more worried about straight men who are sexually malleable and getting engineered by weaponized porn into sissy cucks.  I'm not a cuck; I'm the bull in my real life.  But even I can find that shit strangely arrousing.  What the fuck is going on on Planet Earth and how do we reclaim our masculinity and fight back?  I was looking at the reverses of words relating to my problem like alpha male, and getting into the nuts and bolts about what turns me on and why and who I really want to be or think God wants me to be.  God made me male so I put male down and reversed it and capitalized it and saw Elam and fell in love with the name.  It's pronounced "E" like the letter "e" and then "lom" like the Lombax race of Rachet from Ratchet and Clank.  When I made a gamertag for Xbox Live I chose "Killjoy" because one night my mom called me a killjoy for exposing the story she just told as an exaggeration.  I was upset with the blatant lie and wanted everyone to know.  I had just played and lost to a family friend in 1v1 in Halo 2 by one point with everyone watching, so I decided to associate the name killjoy with Halo and play halo as Killjoy.  My first gamertag was Killjoy1171 because I thought my highschool locker freshmen year was 1171.  It turns out my locker number was 1711 and I had gotten it backwards.  Later on I'm playing halo and got very good and my classmate was like, "I know why you're Killjoy 1171"  And I'm like, "Really, why?" because he's never going to guess that it's my locker number remembered incorrectly.  "Because Master Chief is Spartan 117".  So coincidentally I had made that mistake with my locker number and had 117 in my tag.  This was the first time I learned Master Cheifs number and I thought it was so cool that my mistake ended up working out so well.  Then Later on I got rid of the numbers and just became I Killj0y I with the i's acting as bars because I just wanted to be simply killjoy.  Then in Halo 3 "Killjoy" became a medal for killing someone who's on a killing spree so the announcer would yell out my gamertag every game.

                    It's these types of coincidences that I pay attention to and draw meaning from and in my opinion this is one of the ways God communicates with us.  Synchronicity is one of His languages.  The more you pay attention, the more you'll see God is all around you, waiting to be focused on, waiting to be seen.  Every moment is a gift.  I've experienced my gamertag becominng the number of the Spartan who saved the world.  I've heard it cried out in the game I love.  And now, I've seen Elam in the Bible.
                </p><p>
                    
                        When I came up with the name Elam, I googled it, to see if anyone else had used it, or what it meant, and what I could learn from it.  Nothing came up.  I couldn't find anything.  Now, it has multiple wikipedias, maps of it as a place, and it's in the book of Genesis.  Noah's son Shem has a son named Elam.  This was not there when I searched the bible for Elam, and yet it's always been there.  How is this possible?  Well, you have to understand the implications of the Mandela Effect being true.  The Mandela effect is when multiple people share the same memory of something that history shows never happened.  For example, "Luke, I am your father." was never said in Star Wars if you check right now.  The new line is, "No, I am your father.".  In Tommy Boy when Chris Farley says, "Luke I am your father." that remains unchanged, so people think others are getting confused, but the real truth is that that line was changed in such a supernatural way that it even changed in the past too.  Retrocausality is a quantum physics concept about the effect preceding the cause.  I've linked to an article about it on my blog in /november.

                        Most of you will not believe I am the alpha male.  Most of you will not believe I have come up with an original word that retrocausally has been added to the Bible.  But then again, most people did not believe in Jesus, even after he died, they were in disbelief at his resurrection.  A prophet is not without honor except in his hometown.  I am the prophet Elam, and I am without honor in my hometown.  But if this book can get out there, and arm my people against the Devil, I will have succeeded.  I am not Maxwell Lawrence Jann.  I am Elam.  I will not play by the rules of this Matrix.  I will use the legal name of Max Jann to shapeshift throughout this life until I reach my time to die, but I'm taking the disease with me.  My words will prove true.  My light will shine because God wants it to, otherwise I wouldn't have been created, and I wouldn't have been told to write this book.  Now you know who I am.  I am your hero.  I am Elam.  I am the leader of men.  I am the Moses of the prophecy of a woman who wishes to remain anonymous.  I will lead us to freedom.  We are God's chosen people.  Every single one of us.  It is only the devil, slipping in and out of our hearts, who we need to defeat.

                        Why do bad things happen to good people?  Because our brains are quantum computers and God gave us free will and some of us abuse that gift to selfishly hurt others.  As for the weather harming people, I don't know.

                        God is learning about you.  There is a self-learning algorithm in motion between Good and Evil.  When we finally overcome this world, we will be stronger because of it.  Being in darkness makes the light blinding.  Lucifer calls his knowledge light, but it's because he's a sore loser.  He tells Eve to eat from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, and she takes a bite and it leads to her death.  The devil has given you a screen to weaken you as a knight.  Look at your Apple product at the bite taken out of the apple.  The battle of good and evil is right in front of your face.  I need your help.  Although I say I'm the alpha, I acknowledge that there are men who are a lot better than me in specific areas.  I can use you in those areas.  And you don't need to worship me; just worship God.  I'm just saying in a line of people someone has to be first.  Someone has to be the tallest.  I'm not.  Someone has to be the strongest.  I'm not.  I'm not the best at anything.  I'm no better than any of you.  I'm just the first man to come up with the concept of Elam.  I'm Elam.  Not you.  Who are you?  Let me know.  The best thing about the White Blood Cell analogy is that a Black man can still be a white blood cell because it's an analogy that means more than our skin color.  Black lives Matter is a divisive movement.  Martin Luther King Jr is my hero, and I'm living the dream.  My dream girl left me.  And I'm bipolar.  I'm not perfect.  I'm a weed addict who's 223 days sober on 21mg of Caplyta in sober living, working as a chess teacher and at Best-Buy.  I'll tell you anything you want to know about me, but the only thing that matters or anti-matters is that I am Elam, this is the Book of Elam, and you are more than you know.  You have God inside of you, and you are inside God.
