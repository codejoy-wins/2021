                <h2>Revisiting Monster's Inc</h2>
                <img class="picfloat" src="static/img/monstersinc.jpg" alt="minc">
                <p>I haven't seen Monster's Inc since I learned Satan was running the world.  Hear me out.  Disney+ let's you stream Pixar movies and they've updated the animation in them.</p>
                <p>
                    I put on Monster's Inc just to have a good time, because I remember liking it, but I enjoy watching it with a certain lense, looking for "truth drops" as the youtuber quantum of conscience would say.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    I look for hidden meaning, and symbolism.  Opening scene it's 6:00 o clock, the main character wakes up and has devil horns, and his friend is one big eyeball.  The Devil horns are a shoutout to the devil and the eyeball guy is a representation of the all-seeing eye.  Couldn't find the 3 6's.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Then we get into the plot and it reminded me of free energy and covid.  In the plot, the monster city is said to be powered by children's screams, so monsters are trying to scare kids just to take their energy.  The monsters also have been told by the CEO that children are extremely deadly and touching them is contagious and deadly.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The monsters go through different doors which act as portkeys and take them to the real world.  One day a monster goes through and comes back with a sock on his back.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    Everyone freaks out about the sock and an alarm goes off and the CDA (CDC) comes in to isolate and destroy the contaminant.  It's comedic and complete overkill.  The kids are not even contagious.  The CEO just wants his employees to believe they are contagious so he can keep his scam going. His scam is that a children's laughter can power 1000x more than their scream, but if that secret gets out he won't make any money from his corporation because it will be basically free energy for the whole town with one laugh.  That is a truth drop because it's why we run on gas and they hide free energy from us.  There's no money in free energy for all.  There's lots of money in gas.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The other truth drop is how they treat the monster who had the sock on him, and how they treat the child who escapes into the monster world.  They shave the fur off the monster and give him a shower like in a zombie movie.  They disrespect him and leave him naked in front of everyone and then leave.  That's how people can be treated if we let covid policing go too far.  Loss of human dignity in the name of stopping the spread of a contagion.  And it's all based on a lie.  
                </p>
                <img class="picfloatverysmall" src="static/img/monsterposter.jpg" alt="disney">
                <p>
                    When the girl comes into the monster universe all the monsters have been so brainwashed that they run away screaming...  They've been conditioned by lies to the point of ridiculousness.  A little girl saying "boo" terrifies them even though they're big scary monsters.  This is like people being afraid of a handshake, hug, or an unmasked unvaccinated person sharing a room with them.  Or even someone with Covid.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Am i saying they knew back then about covid, and monster's inc is predictive programming?  Maybe.  I mean the Child Disinfeciton Agency is clearly a play on the CDC and the scream/laugh dynamic is pretty clearly a reference to the free energy conspiracy.  
                </p>
                <p>And look who made it.  Disney.  If anyone's capable of putting out predictive programming, it's them.</p>
                <p>Also the entire idea of a world we can't see feeding off our negative energy is perfectly reasonable to me, so the setup to this movie may be a metaphysical truth.  Lastly, Mike's love interest is a reference to Medusa and they love their Gods and Goddesses.</p>

                <h2>We Happy Few</h2>
                <img class="picfloat" src="static/img/dhop.jpg" alt="dhop">
                <p>
                    I had to post this team review here because it contains conspiracies and I want to keep my <a href="fantasy.html">fantasy webpage</a> free from those.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You really can't feel good about ARob until Fields takes the job from Dalton.  Meanwhile you have Dhop drama with the vaccine and Thielen may also struggle with Kirk Cousins coming out against the vaccine.  I hate to say this but it's hard for me to imagine a qb coming out against the vaccine and then having a great year.  The system we're inside of chews people up and spits them out when they say a bad thing about the vaccine.
                </p>
                <p>
                    DeAndre Hopkins deleted his tweet about contemplating retirement and replaced it with a cryptic tweet, "Freedom?". He wanted to retire because he didn't want to hurt his teammates by having them forfeit games because the nfl rules are different for vaccinated vs. unvaccinated players.  Let me decrypt that tweet for you.  He posted on social media about how he doesn't want to take the vaccine and then he got a call from his agent or someone from the team saying... Take that down.. or "we've deleted that tweet you sent out, here's why..."  Deandre learned that his opinion is not welcome on this matter and he should shut his fucking mouth, so he said, "Freedom"? questionging freedom's very existence because we are not free anymore as we have no freedom of speech.  We only have freedom of politically correct speech.  People are censored left and right, including myself from youtube on multiple occassions with multiple accounts.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I just want to say that the entire idea of having a legal document stating how unvaccinated persons will be treated differently from vaccinated persons is a very dangerous and unfair distinction.  I understand it's done under the pretense of safety and logistics but the reality is we've created two new subclasses of people.  The "Vaxxed" and the "Unvaxxed".  This will inevitably lead to discrimination and conflict and is an evil idea or a stupid one.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If the vaccine was safe and effective they wouldn't need to say that every 5 seconds.
                </p>

                    Ask the league lawyer what he thinks but I think any law that makes distinctions between unvaccinated individuals and vaccinated individuals is a dangerous precident for discrimation.  It will lead to medical tyranny, where you have to "Take your joy" like in the brilliant indie game "We Happy Few"  You don't want to live in a world where you're ordered to take certain medicines.  That's a dictatorship.

                <p>
                    I'm watching the Karate Kid right now.  Haven't seen it in 10+ years.  Jonathan Adampants used to make videos about it so I know it contains some important truths.  I've decided I'm going to draft Davante Adams and name my team Davante Adampants.  I also want to learn karate.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I've been so frustrated lately.  I think part of it is not being able to sleep in my room and having to sleep on the couch while the carpet is replaced.  But honestly I've been having trouble with my emotions lately even before that.  I'm glad I have emotions, sometimes I feel like there's zombies around me wearing masks out of choice and popping Anti-Depressants every day.  At least I have emotions, but now I need a way to channel them.  I know physical activity is necessary but I keep avoiding the gym.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My mom is a black belt and I've taken a few karate classes before.  I remember what it was like.  I think I could use that structure.  Too bad everyone's such a moron with masks.  Maybe I'll just train myself.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm so angry all of the time.  As compassionate as I am at times toward humanity and the homeless and other people, part of me hates them for their ridiculous beliefs.  Not only are most people completely insane, but they think I'm the one who's insane for not wanting to wear a mask or take a vaccine.  People think Chick-fil-a was never chic-fil-a for me and I'm just "misremembering" or it's "not important".  It honestly pisses me off.  I really think excelling in a physical art like karate and harnessing my competetive spirit could do wonders for my mental health.  Joe Rogan often talks about martial arts.  I'm not sure Karate is the one I will like the most but I'd love to explore the martial arts while I'm still young.  29 ain't too old.  I also think the process of weekly classes could encourage me to lose weight.
                </p>

                <p>In my last post I blamed myself for the smell but it's clear now that it's some sort of dead animal inside of my bedroom wall.  I am going to use this experience to never take scent for granted again.  I have vowed to myself to keep my bedroom henceforth smelling like a paradise.  I slept on the couch last night and I have given up trying to spruce up the smell.  I need the apartment people to come in and fix it.  I'm basically living in the living room now, but the girls are out of town so it's not a big deal.</p>

                    I just went 35-0 in Call of Duty: Cold War.  I've gone 35-0 before with an MP7 in MW3.  This is with an MP5 and the Carv Tactical Rifle.  It's a pretty dominant combination as you'll see.  Putting music to this will be difficult because youtube is an asshole.  I actually have to use bitchute for pretty much everything now whether it's a call of duty montage or a conspiracy video.  They removed my last video called "Vaccine Treason"

                <p>
                    New song...  my room smells terrible and I'm trying to make it smell better.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I washed everything and threw everything else out.  I am leaving the windows open and febreezing... it's interesting the metaphysical implications of getting rid of a bad smell.  It's kind of like how darkness and light are often talked about.  Light expels dark and dark is the absense of light.  The bible talks about this often, how the evil people love the dark and how god will bring everything into light in judgment.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Getting rid of a bad smell is different.  It's not as simple as light.  I have to find the root of the smell, and get rid of whatever is actively causing it. (like a wet towel)  Then I have to allow the stale air to escape out the window.  Then I have to install an air freshener and walk around febreezing.  It's so bad.  It's starting to smell a little better because I have done everything I could possibly think of.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    I got rid of my air mattress and went back to sleeping on the floor.  I think the air inside the mattress was one of the causes.  I put all my towels out of my room other than one that is hung up and 2 that are just washed and dried.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If I can't control my environment I can't control very much.  I at least smell good personally.  My guitar strings are new, they used to smell.  My longboard is new... my blanket is washed.  My carpet was just cleaned last week.  I really want to be able to control my environment before I expand outward.  I also want a good home to bring girls back to.  I'm so happy to have been alerted to the importance of scent.  I will never take it for granted again.  I hit some sort of threshold and now smell is super important to me and I can't wait until it smells fantastic in here.  I've worked hard on it all night other than hanging at the pool with my roomates sister tonight until the security guard kicked us out.  It's really amazing living here.  We even just got a brand new washer and drier installed so there's no reason I shouldn't be able to smell great and have a great smelling room.

                    Anyway, I'm just an idiot who can barely control the smell of his own room or self, and orders doordash to work when I'm at home.  That is the inspiration of the song.  PEACE

                    I really enjoy winning in chess and winning in call of duty.  These activities are extremely engrossign and competitive but also easy to do, thanks to online gaming.  If I want to play some one in my level in chess in real life I need to drive to Old Agoura to play this Russian who is better than me, or I'd have to travel to a tournament of some kind.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With Call of Duty it's rare to have a friend as good as me and even then split screen is not as fun as online because there is screenlooking.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    I truly enjoy these 2 activities but I think I'd like to get good at something else.  I'm not actually the best ever in cod, I just had GOAT on my mind that day because of a Quantum of Conscience podcast I was listening to.

                <h2>Levels</h2>
                <p>
                    There's different levels of understanding reality.  I'm going to explain them.
                </p>
                <h4>
                    Level 1 - Fundamentalists
                </h4>
                <img class="picfloat" src="static/img/fundamentalism.jpg" alt="fundamentalism">
                <p>
                    Religious Fundamentalism is the 1st level of Truth.  It doesn't matter if they're Muslim, Christian, Catholic, Protestant, Jewish, Buddist, and any other.  All of these groups suffer from the same groupthink and logical fallacy of thinking everyone at their church is correct and everyone at the other place of worship is incorrect.
                </p>
                <p>
                    These types of groups lack the ability and opportunity to think critically.  They are buried in shame and do not ask obvious questions or address clear contradictions or counter-examples to their dogma.  These types of people lack the courage to wrestle with their own doubt, and cling to books and rely on preachers to guide them like sheep.  These are the types of folk who would donate large amounts to their church and even fall for indulgences back in the day (paying money to be forgiven of sin by the church)  Donating to support a church sounds harmless, benevolent even, but this is only within the first level of understanding.
                </p>
                <h4>Level 2 - Atheists</h4>
                <img class="picfloat" src="static/img/atheists.png" alt="atheism">
                <p>
                    Athiests have the good sense to run away from level 1 fanatics.  They want no part of religion.  They're well aware of the lack of critical thinking within fundamental religion and see themselves as above those equally mistaken groups, and they are indeed above them.  An athiest will actually examine the logical structure of religious belief.  They use their brains and actively pick the bullshit apart.  Bravo.  Congratulations on passing to level 2 of God's game you're playing, but there's much more.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If an athiest walks into a person with a level of understanding above them they will actually confuse them with a level one person.  The true athiest sees himself or herself at the top, just like the level 1 people do.  In fact, Athiests are equally as dogmatic as fundamentalists in thier athiesm.  These typical athiests could all congregate into a church, or a subreddit and participate in group think.  The critical thinking applies to their inspection of fundamental religions, but it doesn't apply to themselves within their own belief in no God.  They insist there is no God. They give God no credit, and they bring great trouble upon themselves when they do.  They're eager to convert you, just like the fundamentalists.  Their critical thinking exists, but it's limited and they suffer from the same characteristics as the fundamentalists and lack originality or substance.  An athiest person is a religious person. Atheism is a religion at war with itself, in denial of it's own existance.
                </p>
                <h4>Level 3 - Agnostics</h4>
                <img class="picfloat" src="static/img/agnostic.png" alt="agnostic">
                <p>
                    Agnostics admit that they don't have all the answers.  Maybe there is a God, maybe there isn't.  There is more nuance and variation in this group and less vitriol.  By admitted they do not know, agnostics open themselves up to potential truths.  By not projecting their fixed beliefs onto the world, they can have an occassional glimpse into true reality.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    Agnostics gathered in a group would have more stimulating conversation on religous topics, because they are able to ask questions and more focused on the quality of the question then the quality of their own answers to use as weapons the way atheists do to the fundamentalists.  Also these Agnostics are more likely to switch between levels, whereas the other groups are less fluid.  One agnostic may have never really thought about it, and another might have read all the holy books and athiest books and still can't make up his mind...  both are level 3 technically, but the educated one's refusal to decide is more profound.  But we're not done yet.
                </p>
                <h4>
                    Level 4 - Truthers
                </h4>
                <img src="static/img/truther.webp" alt="Truther">
                <p>
                    When a person isn't satisfied on their quest for truth they progress through 1,2, and 3.  But they cannot rest at 3.  They swing wildly from belief to belief, trying on different ones like outfits at a shopping mall.  They play and play and search and search for the perfect fit.  It takes years.  Eventually they end up in a youtube rabbit hole and learn that everything is upside down.  They learn that the level 1 people have been fed partial truths to hook them into a lie.  And same goes for each level up to 4.  There is truth in Fundamentalism, Atheism, and Agnosticism, but not enough for the truth to get his fill.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    After alienating most their friends and family the truther realizes that one of the fundamental religions warns of this:  Christianity.  True Christianity starts to occur to the truther.  He left christianity behind when he graduated from level 1 to 2, but now at 4 he has to reexamine what he left behind with a critical lens of both 1 and the 2 he went into.  He makes sure he didn't throw the Baby Jesus out with the bathwater.
                </p>
                <h4>
                    Level 5 - Uniqueness
                </h4>
                <img class="picfloatsmall" src="static/img/mjnew.jpg" alt="mj">
                <p>
                    Level 5 is when the truther stops searching for truth outwardly and starts to instead turn inward and rediscover his or herself.  This results in an overflow of creativity and productivity, like this website, kapeash?
