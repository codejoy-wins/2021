                Starting a new project in a game engine is like starting a new universe as God. I decide where the floor goes, if there is one at all. I decide what players there are and what physics bind them.
            </p>
            <p>
            Throughout my quest to learn programming I have had this divine sensation often. When you are outside of an enclosed system and in charge of everything that happens inside how can you not feel like a god? I can make things disappear, rewrite the laws of physics, all within my created system.
            </p>
            <p>
            Meanwhile, simulation theory has been gaining in its popularity, and I must say, the world does seem to be programmed or at least programmable.
            </p>
            <p>
            Take the A.I. for an enemy in a game I make in the future. When that A.I. reaches it's point, will it realize it is trapped in an enclosed system, of which I am god? Will human beings ever be smart enough to realize that we are trapped in God's game?
            </p>
            <p>
            And who is the real designer of my game? Is it me, or does credit go to God? What if we are in a simulation, and the credit should pass through me, through the game designer we call god, and infinitely regress until the one true God. To me, God is the end of infinite regression. The solution to the paradox. The Alpha and the Omega.
            </p>
            <p>
            But when I boot up unity in 3d, I feel more godlike than when I am doing any other activity. In honour of this godlike feeling I get from designing games, I will name my company "Godlike Games" or something of the sort. Farewell, loyal readers. I highly encourage you to download Unity for free and experience the godlike feeling.
