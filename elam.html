            The Chronicles of Elam
        </p>
        <p>
        The Rock Avalanche
        </p><p>
        
        Elam dashed across the rocky terrain with ease and precision as the rock avalanche started to fall.
    </p><p>
        He wore a green hat like Link and he had a bow and arrow with dragonborn arrows, bloodcursed from his skyrim vr girlfriend vampire.
    </p><p>
        He loved letting her pretend to suck his blood.   It tickled.  You couldn't feel the pain in VR, but this avalanche was real.  Elam effortlessly jumped from boulder to boulder until he reached a safe flat zone.  
    </p><p>
        He readjusted his hat and turned around to get a look at the wreckage.
    </p><p>
        Several robot bees the size of dogs came up from the rubble and smoke and bee-lined to Elam with their red eyes and razer sharp mandibles.
    </p><p>
        Elam drew four heatseeking arrows at the same time and let them loose, each one finding their target.
    </p><p>
        When the one robot bee made it to Elam he had already drawn his greatsword and pulverized it with a swift swing, sending the bee flying away as it's red eyes dimmed from defeat.
    </p><p>

        The Skyhouse
    </p><p>
        The next day was Elam's birthday.  He jumped out of bed, grabbed his skyboard, and jumped out the front door and went into freefall. 
    </p><p>
        During the skydive, he placed his skyboard under his feet and began riding it like a hoverboard on an invisible track.
    </p><p>
        He could grind rails and jump off ramps that weren't even there, because the board had the ability to manipulate it's own impulses from gravity and space and time.  The gravitime continuum.

        A lion-man hunting a dragonslayer.
    </p><p>
        Meanwhile, Drexler was releasing searchers to find and destroy Elam.  His top henchman was named Relik.   Relik was a killer.  Relik stood on a mountain's penensula, overlooking the land below like a lion king.  In Fact, Relik had lion DNA, and roared louder than any person ever could.  
    </p><p>
        The lion-man Relik kept his main trimmed, and wore a mask, but he had lion legs that he pranced around with, walking upright, and his guns were custom made to support his lion paws.
    </p><p>
        Relik was gray, in every sense of the word.  He was gray from all the killing.  All the hunting.  Never stopping to rest... but he could never get Elam.
    </p><p>
        The contract for Elam's head had all but dried up at this point, but Relik took it personally that he was never able to catch him.  He felt like Wiley coyote trying to catch the roadrunner, and his boss Drexler held his failure against him.

        The New Dragontales
    </p><p>
        Elam was famous in cloudland for rescuing the princess from the several dragons that had kidnapped and guarded her.
    </p><p>
        But that was then, and this was now.
    </p><p>
        Elam had a few new dragons to deal with.  Raef and Tbuod clouded the night sky and blocked the moon's light.
    </p><p>
        The princess was scared new dragons would come and take her away again.  All the Dragons of cloudland craved beauty and shiny objects like gold.  Ecnarelot was the only dragon that was leftover from the other dragontales.  But he was getting older, and he recruited Raef and Tboud to be the young dragons that would attack Elam and kidnap the princess again.
    </p><p>
        Elam and Ila, the princess, had to move constantly.  Elam had the local gunsmith carve "Htiaf" into his shield for verbal sorcery protection.  
    </p><p>
        He was the thane of Cloudland at this point, so he managed to order the townspeople to aim all their bright lights into the sky to spot Raef who liked to attack from the stars.
    </p><p>
        Meanwhile Tboud liked to wait for a storm.  When the rain came down, so did he.
    </p><p>
        But Elam, princess Ila, and Cloudland were ready.
