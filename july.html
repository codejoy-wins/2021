                    I just made a dreamboard webpage of all the things I would prefer to have.

                <p>
                    I want a job with coding, a girlfriend as cute as Ariana, a golden chess set and lamborghini, and a penthouse on the beach.
                </p>
                <p>I think I can only hope to achiee these things if I set my mind on them.  I'm not going to stumble into them.</p>

                <p>Ready Player One, Quicksilver, Neo, Tom Brady -- Theory</p>
                <p>Also just want to say... The most obvious advantage to reality exploration as opposed to simulation exploration is that you never know what you might find.</p>
                <p>
                    However, if the simulated world has generative abilities, and I can create a map for you to visit, there may actually be more to visit and discover in the simulated universe.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The reality > simulation advantage of realism could become negligable.  The stakes are always going to be higher in reality because death is truly game over.  But that is both a pro and a con.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The religious aspect of missing out on God's creations of nature is the last remaining pro of reality.  However, God hasn't shown up in a while and it could be possible that he fully intends us to have enough space given to create our own simulated space.  We can take what we know from God's creations and put them into a simulation.  Maybe not exactly, but maybe that is possible to do.  You could even have babies in a simulation and raise them and they could be self aware simulated persons.  That's probably what we are already anyway, idk.

                    It has nothing to do with Kate Upton but I need to generate more traffic to my site and I've been meaning to incorporate her in some way because sex sells.

                <p>Years ago I deleted a rap I made and I'm thankful I remembered it and was able to just rerecord it because I like it a lot and I shouldn't be self conscious.  It's the best I can do!  I think this song has a spot for a quick verse and the verse is about me coming back after a break from xbox live and also about conspiracy theories and how people hate me for them.  In my last post Yeonmi Park talked about how she fears being assassinated in such a way that it looks like suicide.  I can relate to that and that's what my rap was about so I recreated it.  Enjoy!</p>
