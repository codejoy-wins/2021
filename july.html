                <h2>Philosophy of Death and Dying</h2>
                <img class="picfloat" src="static/img/death.jpg" alt="death">
                <p>
                    Today I came home from work and found my roomate dead in his room.  He overdosed on Fentanyl.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm still processing it.  I called 911 and he is now out of the aparment.  They carried him out in a body bag.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There's nothing I could do.  He was purple.
                </p>
                <p>
                    He was 41.  He was a nice guy.  He was overweight.  He wasn't working.  He was waiting for school to start and said he was going to be a teacher.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I've lived with him for a couple months and have a decent grasp on his philosophies and I think they lead to his death.  I hope you guys really hear what I'm saying.  He didn't believe in God.  He didn't believe in excercise. He didn't believe in bettering himself.  He said he wanted to travel, but he never left the house.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    He had a test he could have studied for and passed but he was putting it off.  I found him dead with his laptop open, in his bed with a chick-fil-a still clutched in his hand.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It was one of the most traumatic experiences of my life.  Luckily I had just went to the gym after work before finding him and my endorphins shielded me.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm planning on going to an AA meeting tomorrow morning for some support.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    I hope someone out there can learn from this website and understand that there is a God, and these sinful ways ultimately lead to death.  He died sinning in multiple ways at once with drugs, gluttony, sloth, all that. He was by all standards a decent man.  But he died alone in his boxers in a humiliating way.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I feel like God put me here to witness his self-destruction.  I couldn't have stopped it.  I had just bought him pizza the other day to lure him from his room and he thanked me.  I think I prolonged his life as long as I could.  The cops told me he had a history of overdosing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Life is short.  It's crazy because I just made a <a href="https://youtu.be/sMycI3FgdkI">video</a> about calling 911 and then I had to call them a week later.  Also I've been listening all week to this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCR3RmB3DNZvML6I_bGJ3l4g">youtube channel</a> I posted below about being a successful man.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    Adam and I disagreed about many things.  And as opposite as we are, I'm also similar to him.  He has shown me where the path I was on leads.  I've let myself get overweight, but nowhere near that.  I'm not even 30 yet.  I have some time.  But life is short.  Men must strive to improve themselves and set goals and have systems.  He was just fucking around and got himself killed.  It was an accident on purpose.
                </p>
                <p>
                    All I can say is I'm glad I have Jesus in my life and constantly wrestle with these big thoughts and quesitons about life.  I know my purpose and where I'm going and what's required of me to achieve greatness.  It's not a shock to me that Adam didn't believe in God, got vaccinated, supported black lives matter and calling singular people "they" if they want to be called that.  You might think that has nothing to do with it, but I'm just saying he went along with what Society wanted him to think, and now he's dead.  He had no strong opinions of his own that contradict society.  And that is what makes the man.  He lost the game of life.  He died alone in his underwear in a pile of blood and throwup.  I'm not goign to lose.  I'm going to win.  I'm going to be a winner and it's never been more clear to me how life and death this mindset is for a man to have.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Don't let yourself go.  Grab life by the fucking horns and thank God for creating you, and read the occasional bible verse and show some fucking graditude and respect.
                </p>
                <p>
                    God Bless.
                </p>
                <p class="verse">
                    Revelation 2:7

He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches; To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the tree of life, which is in the midst of the paradise of God.

                    I want a job with coding, a girlfriend as cute as Ariana, a golden chess set and lamborghini, and a penthouse on the beach.
                </p>
                <p>I think I can only hope to achiee these things if I set my mind on them.  I'm not going to stumble into them.</p>

                <p>Ready Player One, Quicksilver, Neo, Tom Brady -- Theory</p>
                <p>Also just want to say... The most obvious advantage to reality exploration as opposed to simulation exploration is that you never know what you might find.</p>
                <p>
                    However, if the simulated world has generative abilities, and I can create a map for you to visit, there may actually be more to visit and discover in the simulated universe.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The reality > simulation advantage of realism could become negligable.  The stakes are always going to be higher in reality because death is truly game over.  But that is both a pro and a con.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The religious aspect of missing out on God's creations of nature is the last remaining pro of reality.  However, God hasn't shown up in a while and it could be possible that he fully intends us to have enough space given to create our own simulated space.  We can take what we know from God's creations and put them into a simulation.  Maybe not exactly, but maybe that is possible to do.  You could even have babies in a simulation and raise them and they could be self aware simulated persons.  That's probably what we are already anyway, idk.

                <p>Years ago I deleted a rap I made and I'm thankful I remembered it and was able to just rerecord it because I like it a lot and I shouldn't be self conscious.  It's the best I can do!  I think this song has a spot for a quick verse and the verse is about me coming back after a break from xbox live and also about conspiracy theories and how people hate me for them.  In my last post Yeonmi Park talked about how she fears being assassinated in such a way that it looks like suicide.  I can relate to that and that's what my rap was about so I recreated it.  Enjoy!</p>
