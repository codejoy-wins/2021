                <h2>Levels</h2>
                <p>
                    There's different levels of understanding reality.  I'm going to attempt to explain them.
                </p>
                <h4>
                    Level 1 - Fundamentalists
                </h4>
                <img class="picfloat" src="static/img/fundamentalism.jpg" alt="fundamentalism">
                <p>
                    Religious Fundamentalism is the 1st level of Truth.  It doesn't matter if they're Muslim, Christian, Catholic, Protestant, Jewish, Buddist, and any other.  All of these groups suffer from the same groupthink and logical fallacy of thinking everyone at their church is correct and everyone at the other place of worship is incorrect.
                </p>
                <p>
                    These types of groups lack the ability and opportunity to think critically.  They are buried in shame and do not ask obvious questions or address clear contradictions or counter-examples to their dogma.  These types of people lack the courage to wrestle with their own doubt, and cling to books and rely on preachers to guide them like sheep.  These are the types of folk who would donate large amounts to their church and even fall for indulgences back in the day (paying money to be forgiven of sin by the church)  Donating to support a church sounds harmless, benevolent even, but this is only within the first level of understanding.
                </p>
                <h4>Level 2 - Atheists</h4>
                <img class="picfloat" src="static/img/atheists.png" alt="atheism">
                <p>
                    Athiests have the good sense to run away from level 1 fanatics.  They want no part of religion.  They're well aware of the lack of critical thinking within fundamental religion and see themselves as above those equally mistaken groups, and they are indeed above them.  An athiest will actually examine the logical structure of religious belief.  They use their brains and actively pick the bullshit apart.  Bravo.  Congratulations on passing to level 2 of God's game you're playing, but there's much more.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If an athiest walks into a person with a level of understanding above them they will actually confuse them with a level one person.  The true athiest sees himself or herself at the top, just like the level 1 people do.  In fact, Athiests are equally as dogmatic as fundamentalists in thier athiesm.  These typical athiests could all congregate into a church, or a subreddit and participate in group think.  The critical thinking applies to their inspection of fundamental religions, but it doesn't apply to themselves within their own belief in no God.  They insist there is no God. They give God no credit, and they bring great trouble upon themselves when they do.  They're eager to convert you, just like the fundamentalists.  Their critical thinking exists, but it's limited and they suffer from the same characteristics as the fundamentalists and lack originality or substance.  An athiest person is a religious person. Atheism is a religion at war with itself, in denial of it's own existance.
                </p>
                <h4>Level 3 - Agnostics</h4>
                <img class="picfloat" src="static/img/agnostic.png" alt="agnostic">
                <p>
                    Agnostics admit that they don't have all the answers.  Maybe there is a God, maybe there isn't.  There is more nuance and variation in this group and less vitriol.  By admitting they do not know, agnostics open themselves up to potential truths.  By not projecting their fixed beliefs onto the world, they can have an occassional glimpse into true reality.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    Agnostics gathered in a group would have more stimulating conversation on religous topics, because they are able to ask questions and more focused on the quality of the question then the quality of their own answers to use as weapons the way atheists do to the fundamentalists.  Also these Agnostics are more likely to switch between levels, whereas the other groups are less fluid.  One agnostic may have never really thought about it, and another might have read all the holy books and athiest books and still can't make up his mind...  both are level 3 technically, but the educated one's refusal to decide is more profound.  But we're not done yet.
                </p>
                <h4>
                    Level 4 - Truthers
                </h4>
                <img src="static/img/truther.webp" alt="Truther">
                <p>
                    When a person isn't satisfied on their quest for truth they progress through 1,2, and 3.  But they cannot rest at 3.  They swing wildly from belief to belief, trying on different ones like outfits at a shopping mall.  They play and play and search and search for the perfect fit.  It takes years.  Eventually they end up in a youtube rabbit hole and learn that everything is upside down.  They learn that the level 1 people have been fed partial truths to hook them into a lie.  And same goes for each level up to 4.  There is truth in Fundamentalism, Atheism, and Agnosticism, but not enough for the truther to get his fill.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    After alienating most their friends and family the truther realizes that one of the fundamental religions warns of this:  Christianity.  True Christianity starts to occur to the truther.  He left christianity behind when he graduated from level 1 to 2, but now at 4 he has to reexamine what he left behind with a critical lens of both 1 and the 2 he went into.  He makes sure he didn't throw the Baby Jesus out with the bathwater.
                </p>
                <h4>
                    Level 5 - Uniqueness
                </h4>
                <img class="picfloatsmall" src="static/img/shelovesme.jpg" alt="mj">
                <p>
                    Level 5 is when the truther stops searching for truth outwardly and starts to instead turn inward and rediscover his or herself.  This results in an overflow of creativity and productivity, like this website.
                </p>

                    I hope this post inspires you to either give Jesus a second look, or to be creative.

                <p>It's refeshing watching something new... for some reason I find myself rewatching things, reluctant to try something new.  But 1st Man, the youtuber I've been following, has videos about Thomas Shelby's body language.  He also analyzes Ragnar from Vikings.  I love Ragnar, but I had never heard of Thomas Shelby, so I thought I'd check it out.  Cilian Murphy is a great actor and just starred in a Quiet Place part 2.  He's also in a bunch of Christopher Nolan movies like inception, batman, and even Dunkirk.  I really like him in a leading role on a show and his character is badass.  I'm definitely going to keep watching and I'm glad I found a new show.</p>

                    Black Widow is a new movie out in theaters but also available via streaming.  Personally I went to the theaters before it was out so I had to settle for the first half of Fast 9 before I walked out.  For Widow, I choose to stream it using my <a href="https://www6.f2movies.to/watch-movie/black-widow-66666.4534076" target="_blank">free site</a>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Black Widow has a tremendous opening scene and an amazing song for the title credits.

                </div>
                <p>
                    Olivia Rodrigo, pop star sensation, recently visited the White house seemingly mostly to push vaccinations to her fans.
                </p>
                <p>
                    First and foremost, Young people don't need to be vaccinated against Covid.  It doesn't even threaten them and actually brings great risk because it's experimental and unneccessary.  The Government is so hellbent on getting people to take this vaccine their actually weaponizing the most popular singer on Tik Tok right now.  I even like her!  I love her music and personality and listen to her album and think she's beautiful.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Putting her next to fauci is just like Pavlonian conditioning where you ring a bell before feeding a dog and the bell makes the dog salivate in the future.  If you train people to love Olivia Rodrigo and then put him with Fauci they will subconsciously love Fauci.
                </p>
                <p>
                    They could have used her to talk about serious issues like drug overdoses and homelessness, and low Testosterone.  My roommate was upset with me for not getting vaccinated.  He killed himself with drugs a month later.  People are completely blind to the real problems of the world.  He was overweight and killing himself and more concerned with me and the coronavirus than getting off drugs and onto a treadmill.  It's embarrassing.  It's ridiculous.  Olivia Rodrigo is a cutie, and I'm not mad at her.  I was watching closely and I'm still not convinced she was even aware of what's going on.  She might genuinely think she's helping.  She might also be an MK Ultra slave passed around at eyes wide shut parties.

                    I already knew she had a manager in the illuminati or whatever because of this picutre but she never opened her mouth about politics until now.  This picture is used as the thumbnail for youtube of her "sour photo shoot".  It's a picture of a photographer taking a picture of her.  The photographer's shirt and elbow are part of the shot making it look like a dick right next to her pretty face to get you to subconsciously click on the video.  Trust me.  I pity the children who will change their mind and receive an experimental jab because of her.  Crazy world.

                <h2>Loki</h2>
                <img class="picfloat" src="static/img/loki.jpeg" alt="loki">
                <p>
                    The cutting edge of entertainment is often the cutting edge of metaphysics.  So when 666 Disney comes out with a series for Loki and I watch the first episode, I look for what new truths they're slipping to us.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It's a great opening sequence.  It's about what happens to Loki after Endgame when he slips away with the tesseract while the avengers are back in time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    He ends up getting caught by time cops who say he's violated the sacred timeline.
                </p>
                <p>
                    His powers are inconsequential and it's almost like being dead and facing judgement against God.  He thinks he is a God, which makes the situation comical.
                </p>
                <p>
                    He's put into a room against his will with a guy asking for his signature.  Sign here to attest to everything you ever said.  Loki argues, and the man just adds his argument to the page.  Then Loki signs it.  This is the first grain of truth.  The idea that everything you've ever done or said will be judged by God at some point.  The bible says that here:
                </p>
                <p class="verse">
                    Matthew 12:36
                    But I say unto you that every idle word that men shall speak, they shall give account thereof in the Day of Judgment.
                </p>
                <p>The second truth in the episode is about the timelines warring with one another and timekeepers merging them into one sacred timeline, that if deviated from, is rectified.</p>
                <p>
                    Loki is seen as a "Variant" or someone who just did something that wasn't part of the sacred timeline and created his own branch of time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My friend has a theory about time and reality that I'll butcher now.  His name is Jokir.  He says that everything has already happened but God is letting you play a create your own adventure book of life.  You jump around to the version you choose to be consciously aware of.  Then, that version of yourself is basically the center of that universe.  But other people are the center of their own universes.  And when you interact with someone else.  You're talking to the version of them that matched the current version of you to collide with similar trajectories.  Like My roommate Adam might still be alive in his universe, but in my universe I was able to see him dead as a warning from God of what could become of me if I don't shape up.  It was exactly what I needed to see.  And then on the other timeline Adam could be living with the version of me who talked him into giving Jesus a chance and exercise and turning his life around.  You never know.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The third truth drop is that Loki isn't evil.  He's just "weakness using illusion to create fear" as they say in the show.  Loki represents God's usage of Lucifer.  God uses the Devil to his advantage.  Without Loki, the Avengers never would have assembled so powerfully.  Similarly, God uses the Devil to make us strong.  If there was no adversary, we would be unfit for God's presence and kingdom after death.  But if we overcome the evil one, then we become worthy.

                <img class="picfloat" src="static/img/death.jpg" alt="death">
                <p>
                    Today I came home from work and found my roomate dead in his room.  He overdosed on Fentanyl.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm still processing it.  I called 911 and he is now out of the aparment.  They carried him out in a body bag.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There's nothing I could do.  He was purple.
                </p>
                <p>
                    He was 41.  He was a nice guy.  He was overweight.  He wasn't working.  He was waiting for school to start and said he was going to be a teacher.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I've lived with him for a couple months and have a decent grasp on his philosophies and I think they lead to his death.  I hope you guys really hear what I'm saying.  He didn't believe in God.  He didn't believe in excercise. He didn't believe in bettering himself.  He said he wanted to travel, but he never left the house.  
                </p>

                    He had a test he could have studied for and passed but he was putting it off.  I found him dead with his laptop open, in his bed with a chick-fil-a still clutched in his hand.

                    It was one of the most traumatic experiences of my life.  Luckily I had just went to the gym after work before finding him and my endorphins shielded me.

                    I hope someone out there can learn from this website and understand that there is a God, and these sinful ways ultimately lead to death.  He died sinning in multiple ways at once with drugs, gluttony, sloth, all that. He was by all standards a decent man.  But he died alone in his boxers in a humiliating way.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I feel like God put me here to witness his self-destruction.  I couldn't have stopped it.  I had just bought him pizza the other day to lure him from his room and he thanked me.  I think I prolonged his life as long as I could.  The cops told me he had a history of overdosing.

                    Life is short.  It's crazy because I just made a <a href="https://youtu.be/sMycI3FgdkI">video</a> about calling 911 and then I had to call them a week later.  Also I've been listening all week to this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCR3RmB3DNZvML6I_bGJ3l4g">youtube channel</a> I posted below about being a successful man.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    Adam and I disagreed about many things.  And as opposite as we are, I'm also similar to him.  He has shown me where the path I was on leads.  I've let myself get overweight, but nowhere near that.  I'm not even 30 yet.  I have some time.  But life is short.  Men must strive to improve themselves and set goals and have systems.  He was just fucking around and got himself killed.  It was an accident on purpose.
                </p>
                <p>
                    All I can say is I'm glad I have Jesus in my life and constantly wrestle with these big thoughts and quesitons about life.  I know my purpose and where I'm going and what's required of me to achieve greatness.  It's not a shock to me that Adam didn't believe in God, got vaccinated, supported black lives matter and calling singular people "they" if they want to be called that.  You might think that has nothing to do with it, but I'm just saying he went along with what Society wanted him to think, and now he's dead.  He had no strong opinions of his own that contradict society.  And that is what makes the man.  He lost the game of life.  He died alone in his underwear in a pile of blood and throwup.  I'm not goign to lose.  I'm going to win.  I'm going to be a winner and it's never been more clear to me how life and death this mindset is for a man to have.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Don't let yourself go.  Grab life by the fucking horns and thank God for creating you, and read the occasional bible verse and show some fucking graditude and respect.
                </p>

                <p>Also just want to say... The most obvious advantage to reality exploration as opposed to simulation exploration is that you never know what you might find.</p>
                <p>
                    However, if the simulated world has generative abilities, and I can create a map for you to visit, there may actually be more to visit and discover in the simulated universe.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The reality > simulation advantage of realism could become negligable.  The stakes are always going to be higher in reality because death is truly game over.  But that is both a pro and a con.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The religious aspect of missing out on God's creations of nature is the last remaining pro of reality.  However, God hasn't shown up in a while and it could be possible that he fully intends us to have enough space given to create our own simulated space.  We can take what we know from God's creations and put them into a simulation.  Maybe not exactly, but maybe that is possible to do.  You could even have babies in a simulation and raise them and they could be self aware simulated persons.  That's probably what we are already anyway, idk.

                <p>Years ago I deleted a rap I made and I'm thankful I remembered it and was able to just rerecord it because I like it a lot and I shouldn't be self conscious.  It's the best I can do!  I think this song has a spot for a quick verse and the verse is about me coming back after a break from xbox live and also about conspiracy theories and how people hate me for them.  In my last post Yeonmi Park talked about how she fears being assassinated in such a way that it looks like suicide.  I can relate to that and that's what my rap was about so I recreated it.  Enjoy!</p>
