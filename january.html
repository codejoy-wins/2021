                    <p>
                        This was orignally designed as a one year project to work on my coding skills.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Then I began blogging to fill up the /blog page of the website.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I had deleted my Facebook but still enjoyed sharing links so the blog was a good place to do that.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Many of the ideas of my blog are experimental and do not accurately reflect my current beliefs.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        My beliefs have a right to evolve and I also would like to play Devil's advocate with the devil being the conspiracy theorist.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Many of the links I've shared have since been removed from youtube.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Many of the words I have written have been seared with anger and do not reflect my current state of mind after writing them.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I intend to edit my past year's blog, rather than continue blogging, to focus more on presentation than content.  Now that the song is written, it's time to record.

                    <p>Thank you, Russell Brand.  My first impression of Russell Brand was when he was Aldus Snow in Forgetting Sarah Marshall.  He made that movie and was an instant sensation.  Then I started to see the real Russell Brand talking on youtube.  I found him to be pretentious, but I think now he's gotten a lot better at his delivery.  I think he's not just some actor spouting philsophy, he's actually gotten a lot of practice delving into complicated ideas that I think he's quite good now.</p>  
        
                    <p>It's like a breath of fresh air to hear someone prominent talk about the dangers we're facing.</p>

                    <h2>Guidelines</h2>
                    <h3>01/20/21</h3>
                    <p>
                        I can't go to the movies.
        </p><p>
        There is a sign posted outside the local movie theater.
        </p><p>
        It says, "We are closed until local and state government guidelines allow us to reopen."
        </p><p>
        Translation: this private company would like to be open, but your governor has forbid us to be open.  He has taken away your right to go to the movies, and our right to provide them to you.
        </p><p>
        Guidelines.  They call them guidelines.  They are not.  They are dictates.  They are unlawful.  They are an infringement on our rights. 
        </p><p>
        Now I went to the theater and saw Tenet the moment it opened.  There were ridiculous rules like wearing mask at all times and having employees get you drinks in a separate section, but it was still enjoyable, to be free.  Even that wasn't good enough for them.  They had to shut it down for what?  For my safety?  Or for total control of what the population can or cannot do with their free will?
        </p><p>
        It is disgusting that these governors can prevent us from going to the movies in the name of public safety. It's a joke.  It's a scam.  It's a lie. If they care about health then why are we able to buy alcohol and tobacco?
        </p><p>
        They only care about control.  Dominion.
