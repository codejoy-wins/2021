                <h2>Godzilla vs. Kong (Post of the Month)</h2>
                <h3>04/08/2021</h3>

                <p>
                    Yes, I'm writing a paper on the new movie Godzilla vs. Kong.  This essay is not for the uninitiated.  I'm not going to hamstring myself by walking you through how I got here.   I'm going to be writing about the bleeding edge of my thoughts.  I think that Godzilla vs. Kong contained many hidden messages and profound meaning.  I think you had the usual Hollywood tricks, but also some truth drops as well as an esoteric theme.
                </p>
                <p>Godzilla represents God.  King Kong represents Humanity.  Mechagodzilla represents technology.</p>
                <p>King kong doesn't bow down to anyone, not even Godzilla.  This pisses Godzilla off.  Godzilla pins King Kong, and instead of finishing him off with his atomic breath, he just roars in his face, and Kong finally submits with a roar of his own acknowledging, "Ya, you win".  Godzilla has proven his point and walks away.</p>
                <p>In an earlier scene, Godzilla attacks the corporation Apex because they are making Mechagodzilla and trying to replace him.  God doesnt like technology trying to play God.  The theme of this movie is that once man submits to God, he and God can work together to overcome technology.  Technology is the real enemy.  The little deaf girl in the film who communicates with Kong even tells him, "Godzilla is not your enemy.  That (Mechagodzilla) is your enemy."  So King Kong, who represents us and our hubris, switches from losing an impossible battle with God, to teaming up with God against technology.</p>
                <p>The hollywood tricks are having things like wacky conspiracy theorists and podcasts and kind of poking fun at the whole truth movement.  They even mention fluoride in the tap water.  Hollywood also drops a 33 several times in the film, but none more significant than in the elevator.   In the beginning of the movie, you have a black podcaster conspiracy theorist trying to expose his own company, apex.  He hacks into the computer and sees something secret on "Sublevel 33" in the manifest.  The number 33 is a reference to freemasonry and the 33rd degree being the highest degree.</p>
                <p>Later in the elevator, the black guy and millie bobby brown and her sidekick are traveling to the sublevel 33 and the sidekick asks, "How deep does it go?"  and the black guy replies, "Hell.  It goes all the way to Hell".  This is one of the most crucial parts of the movie to understand.  Since the 33rd sublevel is a reference to freemasonry, the sidekick is really asking "What happens if you keep progressing after reaching the 33rd rank?"  And then Hollywood is saying back, "You can keep going deeper and deeper into the secret societies until it takes you all the way to hell."  Like the Devil, is an infinity degree mason.  </p>
                <p>See, Lucifer thought he could outdo God.  That's the whole idea of this movie.  Godzilla is God which means he rules over Kings, like King Kong.  God is King of Kings.  But Lucifer thinks he can use technology to overpower God.  Lucifer goes to war with God.  Lucifer loses and is cast out to Earth with his angels.  That's where we are.  Lucifer is still trying to outdo God by playing God himself in a competitive way.  </p>
                <p>
                    So eventually, like in the final scene of the movie, technology and God will go to war again, and humanity will be watching.  And we should side with God and defeat technology.  Instead of rebelling against God, like Humanity is currently doing, we should be rebelling against technology instead and honouring God.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Luciferian mindset would be for Kong to side with Mechagodzilla and watch Godzilla die.  The Irony of that is that Mechagodzilla would probalby kill King Kong after he's done with Godzilla.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    Godzilla is the only thing capable of overpowering King Kong without killing him.  Like, King Kong has to chose in the final scene between two masters.  Technology or God.  Only God will spare him as his master.  Technology will destroy him.  The little deaf girl explains this to him and she would represent wisdom or compassion in this movie.  So Kong sides with Godzilla and then has a truce with him at the end, an understanding that they can work together, and that Godzilla could kill him if he really wanted to, and that's okay,  
                </p>
                <p>
                    Better to deal with the devil you know, then the one you don't.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You cannot serve two masters,  God and Technology.  Either you will hate one or despise the other,  In the bible the two masters are God and Money.  But I think Technology is becoming more important than money. 

                </p>
                <p>
                    Godzilla even has God in his name.  And King Kong is a monkey, and we have most in common with monkies.  I think it's a Titan Metaphor for the relationship between God, Man, and Technology.  I think the deeper you go into freemasonry, the closer you get to hell.  Hell is for people who chose Technology over God.  Hell is the place for The Devil who was Lucifer and all the fallen Angels who thought they could do better than God.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    Trying to replace God is the ultimate act of disrespect toward your creator.  I always operate under the assumption that I know very little compared to God.  I see more wisdom in a tree than I do in most people.  I see the branches sprawling in different directions to get sunlight, and the root structure making the most of its surroundings.  I view nature as supremely intelligent.  Man can try to beat it with technology, but that's a luciferian pursuit.  I think there is a place for technology, but that it's important to respect God and Nature while you're building it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Amen.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Again, if you think you don't need God to get to Heaven.  If you think you can create your own heaven or be your own God that is what Lucifer thought too.  If you think you don't need the keys to Hades that Jesus has to overcome death, if you think you can build your own keys and become immortal yourself with technology then you are antichrist and luciferian.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Also, notice how the human who builds the technology to overthrow God(zilla) ends up getting killed by his own technology.  So, the message God is sending is that if you try to overthrow him with technology it will be your own demise.  That path is death.  Surrendering to God is the only path to life, for King Kong, or humanity.
                </p>
                <p>Thanks!</p>
