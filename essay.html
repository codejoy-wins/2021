            <h2>Guidelines</h2>
            <h3>01/20/21</h3>
            <p>
                I can't go to the movies.
</p><p>
There is a sign posted outside the local movie theater.
</p><p>
It says, "We are closed until local and state government guidelines allow us to reopen."
</p><p>
Translation: this private company would like to be open, but your governor has forbid us to be open.  He has taken away your right to go to the movies, and our right to provide them to you.
</p><p>
Guidelines.  They call them guidelines.  They are not.  They are dictates.  They are unlawful.  They are an infringement on our rights. 
</p><p>
Now I went to the theater and saw Tenet the moment it opened.  There were ridiculous rules like wearing mask at all times and having employees get you drinks in a separate section, but it was still enjoyable, to be free.  Even that wasn't good enough for them.  They had to shut it down for what?  For my safety?  Or for total control of what the population can or cannot do with their free will?
</p><p>
It is disgusting that these governors can prevent us from going to the movies in the name of public safety. It's a joke.  It's a scam.  It's a lie. If they care about health then why are we able to buy alcohol and tobacco?
</p><p>
They only care about control.  Dominion.
            </p>
            <h2>Twenty Twenty One</h2>
            <h3>01/2021</h3>
    <p>
    I wish I was a better man.  I wish I was more powerful.  I wish I had more influence.  I wish I could stop what's happening.
    </p>
    <p>
    It's been 7 months since the government issued a stay at home order.  I was let go by my job due to the restrictions on businesses by the government.  The government issued two stimulus checks and I didn't get either one.   I got my job back by driving by the office to see if they were truly shutting down.  They weren't, and my boss saw me drive by, and then called me up and gave me my job back.  Months later he told me he had called because he saw me drive by and thought I really wanted my job back.
    </p>
    <p>
    I did.  I wanted my job back badly because it was my chance to form my independence and get out of the mental hospitals, residential treatment centers, and sober livings I had been living in the past year.
    </p>
    <p>
    I moved out.  I rented a room near work, and I just got a new car with the help of my parents.  I kept the job for a year which was my goal.  I enjoy it and the people I work with, and I'm glad I have earned my independence and do not have to attend daily AA meetings or therapy sessions.
    </p>
    <p>
    The company I work for just issued a mandatory mask mandate at all times.  Originally I only had to wear one while moving around, but was allowed to take it off at my desk.  The thought of wearing a mask every day all day is unbearable to me.  I left work early and I am attempting to get a doctor's note to exempt me from the new mandate.  I do not think I will succeed, but I did get my boss to allow me to put the mask below my nose so that I can breathe.  This is a small consolation prize.  Others are not so lucky.
    </p>
    <p>
    The Vaccine Mandate is inevitable.  I do not want a vaccine.  I do not trust big pharma, the cdc, or the government.  I will be fired for refusing to take the vaccine, if I'm not already fired for refusing to wear the mask.
    </p>
    <p>
    The vaccine is rushed and unsafe.  It is a special new type of vaccine called an mRNA Vaccine.  It injects genetic code into your body to trick your body into creating a virus.  The hope, or the con, I should say, is that your body will then defeat the virus and be ready for it in the future.  Most of the time, vaccines simply insert a weak or cousin version of the virus into your body, and your body fights it and learns from it.  That is how vaccines were invented and proven effective.  That is not how the experimental covid vaccine works.  The covid vaccine will mess with your genetic material.
    </p>
    <p>
    Let me ask you this question.  Would you like a rattlesnake venom vaccine right now?  A rattlesnake could end up killing you if you don't take some of it now.  Or, would you prefer to have an antidote, if you are ever bitten?
    </p>
    <p>
    Vaccines are not desirable under any circumstances.  They are dangerous.  They are exposing you to illness in the hopes that it may help you in the future.  Any side effects caused by them are not the concern of the pharmaceutical companies that made them because they are not liable in court because they bought all the politicians.
    </p>
    <p>
    They even bought the CDC.
    </p>
    <p>
    Vaccines are potentially brilliant.  If nothing else works, and you do it correctly, maybe it is the best solution.  However,  other methods should be pursued first.  Making a vaccine is an inherantly delicate process and rushing a new one into a global population could have serious risks such as infertility.  
    </p>
    <p>
    This could happen by mistake, or on purpose.  I don't trust big pharma either way.
    </p>
    <p>
    This is the end of democracy.  This is the end of freedom.  This is the adolescence of a global control system that governs everyone, all of the time.  
    </p>
    <p>
    They will not come out and say it until it is too late.  They may never say it at all.  Ask yourself, if your group was trying to take over the world totally, would you announce it beforehand or claim to be working in the world's best interests?  These people aren't shy about lying.
    </p>
    <p>
    On September 11th, 2001 the twin towers were destroyed.  We were told it was by terrorists hijacking commercial planes and flying them into the tops of the buildings, causing the buildings to crumble to the ground after staying upright for a bit while the fire magically made it's way to the foundation and pulled out the bottom jenga blocks.  
</p>
<p>
    Then we declared war on terror.  We tried to catch Osama Bin Laden.  We claimed there were weapons of mass destruction and went to war in the middle east in multiple countries, killing multiple leaders, and we found nothing.  We were told we caught Bin Laden and buried him at the bottom of the ocean.  
</p>
<p>
    The war on terror, which cannot feasibly end based on the word "Terror",  caused Americans to lose their right to privacy.  We have all of our phone calls and emails recorded by the government.  They track our movements and communications.  They have thwarted exacly 0 terrorist attacks with the information they got from Americans even though that was the justification in the first place.  They have admitted it has not helped in a single example.  
</p>
<p>
    Now the pandemic.  Simulations by Bill Gates were run a couple years ago and now they have come to pass.  The world is experiencing a pandemic.  Real or fake, the impact of the government's reaction to it has been fatal.  Suicide rates are up, overdoses are up, many small businesses have collapsed due to their inability to function with the new government covid 1984 regulations.  
</p>
<p>
    Schools closed.  Church gatherings were forbidden.  Parties were frowned upon, sometimes downright illegal.  Curfews are in effect in Belgium, with drones enforcing them and social distancing.  
</p>
<p>
    I can't think of a worse world to live in than one where drones follow you at night and prevent you from touching your girlfriend or showing you face in public.  But that's where some of us are, right this very second.
</p>
<p>
    The worst part of all is the trickery and deception.  The sheep shepherding each other.  Common knowledge is that we should abide by these rules in order to save lives.  Most people agree that this will pass, and it's the right thing to do to give up a little freedom here and there, for the greater good.  Nothing could be further from the truth.
</p>
<p>
    The lockdown won't end.  They said 2 weeks and it's been 7 months.  The only way the lockdown ends is with a global vaccination agenda which will be far worse and result in infertility or genocide.  
</p>
<p>
    I could be wrong.  I've been wrong before.  I thought Jesus was real and could use me to heal this world.  They locked me up and forced me to take antipsychotic medications.
</p>
<p>
    I've been off of my meds now for several months.  I am completely and utterly sober.  I have a fulltime job, and a college degree.  I pay my taxes, and this is my opinion on the current state of affairs.
</p>
<p>
    There are better ways to combat the coronavirus.  Promoting health would be really great.  Closing fast food restaurants and things like that would be smarter than closing gyms, schools, and churches.  
</p>
<p>
    People need each other.  The idea that we should all social distance and cover our faces is ludicrous.  Hugs and smiles are good for your health, and we aren't getting as many of them.
</p>
<p>
    I may have made some religious mistakes in the past but I am not a fool. I'm a 2000+ rated chess expert with a philosophy degree from UC Santa Cruz and a coding certificate from Coding Dojo.  When you know what I know, it's absolutely terrifying.
</p>
<p>
    Big Brother is watching you.  He's making sure your face is covered at all times.  He's making sure you can't get close to anyone else or have any type of gathering. He's tracking your location.  He's reading your texts, emails, and listening to your phone calls.  He's telling you when you're allowed to go outside, and when you're supposed to stay at home.  He's telling you whether or not you're essential.  This is all real.  This is really happening.
</p>
<p>
    If humanity wants to band together and fight the spread of a contagious virus then go for it, but that isn't what's happening.  Deep down, very deep down, most people want to take the damn mask off and go back to normal, but they can't; they'd be ostracized, demonized, attacked, shamed, and refused service.
</p>
<p>
    This is really, really, really bad, and scary.  This is the end of freedom. This isn't people freely choosing to fight the spread of a virus because of how horrible it is.  This is a handful of people ordaining how we have to live, without doing it themselves.  They control the narrative and literally censor detractors off of youtube or social media and say it's because they're "dangerous".  
</p>
<p>
    The only danger here is a totalitarian Covid 1984 dictatorship.  With forced mask mandates, vaccinations, social distancing, and curfews.
</p>
<p>
    How would life under the Taliban be any different?  Surely there are sizable similarities here.  And ask yourself, which direction we are going?  Contact tracing will be the new excuse.  Look at China's social credit system.  It's pure evil, and we're too stupid to prevent it from happening here.  
</p>
<p>
    There is no leadership.  The best we have is Joe Rogan who just signed a $100 Million Dollar deal and is very unlikely to push against anything right now.  
</p>
<p>
    Elon Musk has been on record saying we gave away our liberty too easily but he can't do everything.  He's not a politician and that's unfair to ask of him.  
</p>
<p>
    I wish I could help the people.  I want so badly to but it's an enormously uphill battle, and I've started from the bottom of a ditch.  
</p>
<p>
    I can hardly help myself.  I tried helping a girl banker with her mask mandate and it ended up backfiring where the next day my company issued a mask mandate.
</p>
<p>
    Now we have a new president too.  It's a treacherous time to be alive.  It truly is.  Covid 1984 is a false flag.  It's too perfect for these governors and pharmaceutical companies to be happenstance.
</p>
<p>
    I guess I'm just along for the ride.  I will never give up though.  I will try to stop this global conspiracy, even if I'm wrong, even if it takes my sanity away.  I will try to stop it.
