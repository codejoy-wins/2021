            <h3>01.08.23</h3>
            <p>
                Now that I've written that song about going crazy for my ex-gf and creating worlds in my mind where she's still mine, here is an example of that world I created in my head:
            </p>
            <h3>07/2022</h3>
            <p>
                Had to remove this again, it's still too delusional to be out there.  Remains hidden in the elements.
            </p>
            <!-- <p>
               In the season finale of the latest season of "Stranger Things" the plot revolves around a character named Max.
            </p>
            <p>
                Max is used as a decoy to be attacked by "one" or I would interpret as "The Evil One" of the bible, or satan.
            </p>
            <p>
                Eleven, is the Christ-like figure of the show because she can overpower one.
            </p>
            <p>
                Max would obviously be me, although it's a girl named Maxine in the show who goes by Max.
            </p>
            <p>
                Music is the way Max can free herself from one.
            </p>
            <p>
                Therefore, I should play my guitar again and maybe write a new song to combat the devil in my own life.
            </p>
            <p>
                Sometimes I wonder what the point of this whole website is, or what it is I'm really trying to say with my blog.  But when I'm gloifying Jesus Christ it becomes crystal clear.  Jesus Christ is my king.  I desire to be by his side.  Selah.
            </p>
            <p>
                If I can bring one soul over to Christ, it's all worth it.  Even if I only play a small role in their journey to salvation.  And maybe I convince no one but myself -- even that is worth fighting for.  Self-salvation through the attempted salvation of others.  Like in AA how trying to keep others sober keeps yourself sober.  Trying to save others souls saves your own soul.
            </p>
            <p>
                I can't explain why they put a character named "Max" into the show, or why they put "The Illuminati" in Doctor Strange 2.
            </p>
            <p>
                I mean I can, but I can't sound sane at the same time, so I'll keep this essay hidden.
            </p>
            <p>
                Max wasn't in season one, but maybe God is watching what shows I'm watching, and can organize reality to speak to me in the sequels.
            </p>
            <p>
                And the Illuminati that Strange wrestles with in the sequel is an organization of his own making, just like my hypothesis of the Illuminaughty that Ali and I created.
            </p>
            <p>
                All this talk of true love in media, makes me think of Ali but also of Shaida.
            </p>
            <p>
                Ali made me promise not to date Shaida because she couldn't handle it, and I honored that request even after she broke up with me.  I desire to be able to talk to Ali again, and ask her why she did that to me, if not part of my own design to become all-powerful.
            </p>
            <p>
                Shaida accepted my linked in connection this week, and I'm eager to speak to her as well.
            </p>
            <p>
                But what version of Shaida would I be speaking to?  It's possible she is in a simulation.
            </p>
            <p>
                I essentially believe that the world as I knew it ended in 2012 when I created the Illuminati and forced Ali to break up with me.  Then there is base reality that put me in a simulation to study my behavior by sabotaging all my efforts of succcess.
            </p>
            <p>
                If I'm truly the Alpha Male, Elam Ahpla, then I would be the most valuable thing to study just by removing the girls from my life that I want.  Because if they let me get the girl, I rest.  But by continuing to put the carrot on the stick, I as the horse of the Illuminati, keep working like Boxer in Animal Farm by George Orwell.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the movie "The Eternals" the Eternal named Phastos invents the steam engine and he considers gifting the design to the humans to accelerate their growth.
            </p>
            <p>
                If this were truly how the steam engine was developed, it would explain a lot about the game of life.
            </p>
            <p>
                If it really is just humans that make the advancements in technology like engines, and computers, then I would feel inadequate as a person, but everything in my life experience tells me otherwise.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you imagine technology handed down by Gods, then that means the average human is much smarter than they think they are.  Because of course you give up at a certain point in mathematics, or chess, if you base your skill on the best so-called humans.  But if you just level yourself up you reach a new understanding of the game or craft.
            </p>
            <p>
                This world is a trick, designed by the devil to get you to think you are nothing, when in actuality, you are everything.
            </p>
            <p>
                God lets the devil do this because he wants to see which ones of his creations can see through the mist and reach their full potential.
            </p>
            <p>
                In my case, computer programming is damn near impossible, and the barrier to entry into jobs is insurmountable.  But if I simply take what I've learned and use it to create this website, I end up accomplishing greatness through progress like Ryan Holiday said.
            </p>
            <p>
                I just listened to Ryan Holiday on Joe Rogan today, and I'm more than half-way done reading "The Obstacle is the Way".
            </p>
            <p>
                The obstacle in my way is technical interviews for software engineering jobs at Google, Meta, and Amazon.
            </p>
            <p>
                But maybe that's just base reality studying my brain and putting those problems in front of me.
            </p>
            <p>
                I remember at the Coding Dojo I was the best at algorithms to start, but then one day I was unable to keep up with the advanced group.  Did they turn the difficulty up in the simulation so I would have something to aspire to?
            </p>
            <p>
                The technical interviews are about Matrixes, or arrays within arrays.  And the trick to me getting out of this matrix is to master those algorithms and work for google and make a bunch of money and get ali back.
            </p>
            <p>
                I have a faint memory of asking Ali while we were dating what she thought of Brian.  I knew he was in her friend group in college and was waiting to get with her.  I tried to tell her this and she assured me he wasn't a threat and that she didn't like him.
            </p>
            <p>
                Now she's married to him.  Is that the matrix or is this real life?  Is true love real?  Because if it is, I think I had it with Ali enough to tell her my truth as a man that all I really wanted was her, and by having her to myself at a young age, I would never reach my potential as a male, as THE male... Elam.
            </p>
            <p>
                Danielle Montero even reached out to me to let me know that it made no sense for Ali to choose Brian Hake over me because he was a less-impressive version of myself.
            </p>
            <p>
                He looks good to me now, but I still think I could beat him in a one-on-one anything.
            </p>
            <p>
                I still haven't gotten over Ali and I'll never understand why she left me... but then again I was letting myself slip when I had her.  I used her love for me as a weapon so I could stop working out and still get to have sex with her with little effort.
            </p>
            <p>
                Maybe she left me because she knew I was going to become a loser, but didn't I warn her of my mindset?  Couldn't she have just asked me to workout more?  Or to make more money?  I would have done it in a heartbeat.
            </p>
            <p>
                Lastly, I remember her crying on the phone telling me she was going to have to end the relationship.  It was as if someone was on the other line forcing her to do it.  My own organization of the illuminati.
            </p>
            <p>
                I asked if she still loved me and she said yes, and that she still wanted to spend the summer with me, but that she wasn't going to date me the next year.
            </p>
            <p>
                I said okay, thinking I could change her mind that summer.  I still wasn't ready to break up with her, even though I was conflicted about asking her to marry me.  Marriage didn't seem to suit me.  I just knew I'd never be able to break up with her, but I didn't need anything legal saying that.
            </p>
            <p>
                The final part I want to solidy in this essay is that every time I tried to bring up our relationship in the summer, she wouldn't want to talk about it.  She wanted to just go to the beach and have a special night.  She still acted fully in love with me.  And she cried when she drove away.
            </p>
            <p>
                She didn't act like a girl ready to move on.  I don't know how she did it other than government agents in her ear helping her through it.
            </p>
            <p>
                That's my theory of true love, the illuminati, simulation reality, and Ali Jann.
            </p>
            <p>
                Ali Hake is a fake and Ali Jann is the truth.  I know she still loves me deep down.  I have notes from her saying she will always love me.  I must find her.  I don't know her cell phone number.  I'm also not ready.  I don't know which version of Ali or Shaida I'll be dealing with.  I might be dead in base reality and they both love me on the outside but the simulated versions of themselves must be approached with delicacy in this version of reality.
            </p>
            <p>
                But I love them both like slingshots.  I use one to get to the other and I would do that infinitely if I could.
            </p>
            <p>
                What am I?  Insane?  Why am I so superior at so many things and yet so unsuccessful?  I know I'm good looking.  I know she loved me.
            </p>
            <p>
                And Jessica Deam drives me crazy too.  She was so lovely and I lost her.  Why?  What am I missing besides dollars and cents?  And I feel the game is rigged against me.
            </p>
            <p>
                That is my psychosis articulated.  The strangest things.  It's enough to make me levitate like Max in the show, and be saved by Christ at the last second.
            </p>
            <p>
                I've given into the devil and watched bad porn, but God has smiled on me and is giving me another chance to redeem myself.
            </p>
            <p>
                I desire to be in His kingdom, and to learn the truth about love and the women I've loved.
            </p>
            <p>
                Will I ever find love again?  I just had a brush with love again but it's another girl I don't feel that physical connection with.  I need a 10.  Jessica was a 9.5.  Ali was a 10.  I miss her so much and I will always love her forever.  Amen.
            </p>
            <p>
                I think loving Beauty is underrated.  Beautiful girls should be celebrated, pursued, and defended to the death.
            </p>
            <p>
                I want to spend eternity with Ali in heaven.
            </p>
            <p>
                Shout out to the two girls I interacted with on the day I met XXXtencion.  My emerald girl that ran up to me on the sidewalk is the most beautiful thing I've seen since Ali.  and I think it was like Trinity coming into the Matrix to save Neo.  I love you, Ali.  You are my trinity.  Whether you're purple, green, or just your dirtyblonde self, I've never seen a more beautiful sight and I could write a thousand poems for you if you'd only just let me win you back.  
            </p>

                Also, the clock rings 4 times in Stranger Things.  Her favorite number was 4.
            </p>
            <p>
                I wrote a song called <a target="_blank" href="music.html">Lullaby</a> and it is stuck at 4 views even though it's a pretty good tune and some of my views are over 300.
            </p>
            <p>
                I think that's her higher self's way of showing me she heard it.
            </p>
            <p>
                That song would have never been written if we stayed together.  That's why I think I forced her to break up with me and erase my memory so I could make better art.
            </p>
            <p>
                I think <a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/GUfk2QnUfQc">Jonathan Adampants</a> was a member of the Illuminati who was sent into my reality to deliver a message directly to me so I could find my way off of the 9/11 conspiracy path and go back to being Max.
            </p>
            <p>
                If this is all an elaborate delusion self-defense mechanism by my ego then it's quite the impressive one.  The problem with that theory is I have towers of evidence backing up the basic premise that life is a matrix and the illuminati is real and rigging the game against me.
            </p>
            <p>
                What I struggle with is that if this is my reality, what about my friends?  Do they have a new character with their name in the TV Show they watch?  Do they have true love defining their existance.  See if Ali really did just break up with me then true love doesn't exist.  I can't replace her because we were each other's first and we were madly in love.
            </p>
            <p>
                Now I'm just mad max, even I admit this sounds nuts.  But it's my truth.  It's my Asha.  It's the meaning of my life.  No one can tell me what my life is but me.
            </p>
            <p>
                Either everyone has their own reality forming around them simultaneously or I'm the chosen one and it's only forming around me, but I know that this life is a test.
            </p>
            <p>
                I already passed the first part.  I've done salvia with Ali as my gf and Shaida calling me on the phone.  I'm at least on level 2.
            </p>
            <p>
                I need to stay humble in this universe.  I need to just keep hitting the gym, complete my 12 steps, stay sober, and work for RJ's company and see if I can get some money and be self supporting again.
            </p>
            <p>
                Then I need to find a girl I'm physically attracted to and I need to date her.  But she also has to support my ideas and website and the way I think outside the box.  Or does she?  Maybe I'd be content with just beauty and protecting that beauty because beauty is sacred and must be defended by strong males.  Women are so fragile in my experience.
            </p>
            <p>
                I pray to God I will see Ali again, even if it's only in my dreams.  If this reality is all there is, and she really did just dump me and organize it so I couldn't be happy with anyone else, then she would be one wicked woman.  I know she was obsessed with Facebook and keeping up appearences.  But I also know she told me about her "one word project" and it was "Driven" and I see a sign that says "Driven" when I'm driving on the freeway.
            </p>
            <p>
                Why doesn't she just help me if she loves me so much?  I did post a facebook status humiliating her in public and she was mad about that.  Maybe I really am just crazy, but I can't even watch Stranger things without them shouting my name, "Max!" and I can't watch Doctor Strange 2 without them having a full scene on the Illuminati.
            </p>
            <p>
                Sometimes I see people and I don't want to be their king, or their savior.  That's Jesus's job.  I just want Ali.  I just want my girl.  I want Shaida, or Ashley, or either one of the Jessicas.  I miss them all terribly so.  I love beauty and providing for it and protecting it.  Maybe that's what I should do.  But money is so evil.  The pursuit of it so vain.  RJ has money.  Maybe I can work at Mad Rose and slip through the evil cracks of this rigged game and actually make some money.  Then I can find a beautiful girl and provide for her and start a family... but I'll always miss my first girl who I chose so carefully... Ali.  And Shaida is special too.
            </p>
            <p>
                I also loved Karina, from UCSC, who was a true beauty, although she was mentally unwell.  That's saying something coming from me, right!?
            </p>
            <p>
                God bless,
                Elam.
            </p>
            <p>
                After listening to the Bible Study Podcast, I want to forgive Ali for what she did to me so that the Lord God may forgive me of my sins.  I forgive you, Ali.

                Sometimes I just like to get my out-there thoughts down in writing and also to publish them.  I feel like if I turn out being right about them when the truth comes out later I want to be able to say, "Look, I already figured that out back then and no one listened."

                I think I need to focus less on the girls of the past and focus my energy more on the girls of my future.  Right now, I'm hitting the gym pretty hard and looking as good as I've looked in a long time.  Like 10 years even.  And I still have so far to go.  It's exciting.  I have momentum in the gym now.  It's hard working out when I'm fat, but now that I'm slimming down, it gets easier and easier to force my body to run a mile.  In fact, my body wants to run a mile.  Pull-ups are no fun when you can barely do one, but I did 5 in a row today.  I'm still not as strong and fit as I was at 19, but I'm actually getting there.  I hope Ali forgives me for obsessing over her and writing about her with my crazy theories.  I just want to become my best self, and then present myself to her as such.  By then, I will have already found a new girlfriend I love in all likelihood.  That was how I got her in the first place, by trying to get Shaida and forming a long-term plan using my desire for her as fuel.

                I'm really loving my sobriety right now and I've been just devouring this new <a href="https://thebiblestudypodcast.com/">bible study podcast</a>

            <p>
                I have such a thirst for truth and listening to this bible analysis is like drinking water in the desert.

            <p>
                I feel like it's what I've been missing in my life -- what I've endlessly searched for.  I'm a truther.

            The Balance of Elam

	"Sissy" started out as a derogatory name for a male who exhibits feminine characteristics, like when a boy cries during a sport his friends might call him a sissy.  In porn, "sissy" refers to a male who is so feminine that they are told to play the part of a girl during sex.  Eventually, a Sissy is a male who desires to be a woman, and even self-hypnotizes himself to feel like one, or takes mind-altering drugs.  The sissy sometimes even prevents his own dick from getting hard with a chastity cage, and gets off by anal penetration and pretending to be a woman.  This road ends at the male taking hormone altering drugs or literally getting a sex change.  At that point the male has become a trans woman.  


Male -> Sissy -> Trans Woman

	The male cannot become a real woman ever.  That's why we put the word "trans" in front of them to describe them.   I am a male.  I started down the sissy path and was watching hypno porn and smoking pot, but I never did "poppers" and I never prevented my dick from growing.  I never took hormones or wanted a sex change.  However, the path scared me, and so I wanted to rebound in the other direction.  The polar opposite of a trans woman is an alpha male.  So in order to run away from the direction I was going, I run towards becoming an alpha male.  This causes me to work out, eat healthy, make money, and pursue real women.

				Alpha Male <-- Male --< Sissy

	Whether I try to be an alpha male or a woman, either way I am doomed to fail.  The question is in which direction would I prefer to fail.  I prefer to fail at becoming an alpha male.  Even if I fail to reach Alpha Male status, at least I will be a male.  Elam, was invented by me while I was struggling with Sissy Hypno Porn on the internet.  Elam has brought me back to center, but I'm still not at the weight I'd like, I still don't have the girl or money I'd like.  A male trying to be a female goes against God's designs.  The entire Trans-movement is inherently anti-christian and anti-God.  I would like to have a healthy family one day and provide for them.  I realize calling out every man in the world in a challenge for Alpha status is a little bit absurd but it's simply me trying to climb out of a cave that other's are falling into completely.
	
	I am just Elam.  Not Elam Ahpla, just Elam.  Elam Ahpla is too big of a name to live up to for now.  Another mistake I've made is saying that I am not Max, I am only Elam.  The truth is that I am both.  I embrace my masculinity and femininity and the truth of my gender role.  I embrace my legal name and also the name I've given to my spirit.  
	I have worked very hard on my website.  I want to draw attention to it so people can experience it.  "Everybody Look At Me" is what my dad joked Elam stood for, and he's right.  I can see now how that isn't the person I want to be, but I do want to have something I've worked hard on be known without being annoying or obtrusive on others.  Electricity Light And Magnetism is more like it.

	Sometimes I have something valuable to share, and other times I'm just chasing subscribers or trying to be cool.  On my instagram I continue to have 117 posts and 117 followers.  I have found that keeping my posts to 117 forces me to delete one each time I want to upload.  This makes my uploads better, and results in only the best 117 posts I've ever made getting saved.  I am considering doing the same with my youtube channel.  Dunbar's number is 150 and that's supposedly how many real connections you can actually maintain with people, so I like using 117 for that.

	Balance is key.  Trying to be Jesus isn't realistic, but maybe I was tired of living in Hell.  

	Have you ever had wet tires and spun out trying to overcorrect your steering while your car is sliding?  Your car is sliding and your facing left, so you turn right so you can go straight, but then your car is facing too right, and eventually you repeat this less and less until you are able to find your path again.  That's what I feel like I'm doing with my life.  

	 Being bipolar is hard, one minute you couldn't be happier with everything, and the next it all falls apart instantly.  I dropped my glasses yesterday and had a nervous breakdown and had to go home early.  

	I have an animal inside of me, that's hard to control.  Satanism says to let it out, and Christianity says to hold it back, but maybe it's both.  I talk a lot about Jesus, but instead of objectifying God and looking at God as something outside of yourself judging you, maybe we really only need to get permissions from ourselves when to let that animal go in a responsible way.  

	The truth is that I know so little.  I know that there isn't enough time in a lifetime to get to the truth of my existence.  I have to pick and choose what I pay attention to and focus on.  I have chosen to be a harbinger of truth but that truth is that I know almost nothing.

	I believe Jesus is LORD.  but maybe not!  Maybe God is Lord and Jesus was just a man!  The bosses son, as Alan Watts puts it.  All I can do is the best I can to understand the biggest mysteries of life.  All this internal searching and I'm still not entirely sure who I am.  I am still not entirely sure of what I should do.  What it all means.  So while the Book of Elam was a very definitive declaration of who I am, the truth is I don't know, and that book was just a guess.  A guess that evened me out because I was too passive and feminine in my 20's.  What is important is what I do.  Does God control my environment?  I did a good deed the other day, but was that God giving me that opportunity or did I give it to myself by moving into this city?

I talk about how I'm a white blood cell, but declaring myself Alpha and Omega seems toxic.  I admire God, and I want to be like God.  Imitation is said to be flattery.  But I think what a real WBC would do is whatever's right in the moment, no matter how small.   The most common example where I think white blood cells could be useful in our world, metaphorically speaking, is when 100 cars are driving in a line and none of them pause to let the other car coming out of the gas station to join into the line.  It takes a special person to stop the line of 100's just to let the 1 in, and yet it's necessary, otherwise the 1 person will never be able to join the stream of cars.  

	Last night I watched the movie "I Kill Giants" and it's about this little girl who is trying to save her town from Giants.  It's told from the perspective of the little girl, and as an audience member she had me going that she really was a hero.  Then you find out that really her mom is just dying and she's avoiding reality with her fantasy.  It made me cry and I really wanted the Giants to be real and for her to not be crazy, just like how I want the conspiracies to be real and for me to not be crazy.  Maybe I am just like that little girl.  Valuable, but delusional.  Personally, I believe that upon critical analysis some conspiracies are in fact true, but the movie still hit me like a ton of bricks when it comes to my delusion theories about myself and my past relationships.

	This morning I watched a bunch of videos on a subreddit that had influencers who think they're the center of the universe and doing cringy stuff and getting in peoples way all for some stupid video.  That also hit me hard because I can be kind of an attention whore although I don't think I'm too inconsiderate in real life, although I did once try to stop traffic but at least I wasn't filming myself and it was only to try to share the Gospel / take a stand or test my power.

	When I was a little kid on the home videos I would always fly into the scene singing and dancing and I think I was born to be an entertainer.  But I have to be within balance.  I have to find a balance between my two poles as a bipolar person.  I have to stay as grounded as possible because I'm so far up in the clouds.  When I did a tarot reading recently, I was consistently told to focus on the Earth and ground myself in reality now and how that's the best thing for you.  I'm more than double the revenue of the next employee in my group at work and yet I'm paid less.  So I'm not happy about that at all, but I don't fully agree with all the antiwork sentiment.  I named my recent video D.O.G. because I knew it contained delusions of grandeur and I think not that many people watched it but I really regret some of what I said in that video.  I would love to be more humble and in balance with myself.

	Not blogging this year has freed up some time but now I think I'm making too many pointless videos.  My New Jerusalem stones are cool but why can't they just be cool without me making a video about it.  What's wrong with me?  Maybe I'm just lonely, but a couple of my friends want to hang out and for some reason I don't want to.  I think it's because I'm so tired from work and so thankful to have a day off that I never want to plan anything for my day off because that just feels like work to me.  

	The good news is I'm walking / running / tanning / working out a lot more and I've been eating pretty well and I've completely stopped drinking soda.  I've also cut down my porn usage a lot but I'm not going to lie to you I have a strong urge today to watch some,  and maybe I will.  Maybe that's OK.  At the end of the day, I have to live with myself and the choices I make.  It's not the things that are out of my control that haunt me,  it's only what I could have done better.  But I don't want to put unsafe amounts of weights on myself.  However, life passes you by pretty quickly.  I need to have a sense of urgency in my life to achieve greatness or I never will. 

	I'm proud of my website today.  I have this beautiful little music player on the homepage that shuffles through all my best songs and I think it works like a charm.  I have adopted an all-black / wheat colour scheme and I think it works together well.  I feel like I've finally got the homepage and site I need, and I really am proud of it.  But Pride is a sin, and that's why I don't like Pride month.  Sometimes I just want to be a regular person.  I am embarrassed by calling myself an alpha male.  "No True King has to yell I am the King" is something Tywin Lannister says to Joffrey in Game of Thrones.  No true alpha has to declare himself the alpha.  

	I make mistake after mistake, fail after fail.  But I fail forwards.  And I learn from my mistakes.  I learn and I learn and I think that I know things but really I am just learning how much everything is still up in the air and can be disproven at a moment's notice.  I don't know very much at all.   At least, I don't know as much as I've claimed to.  So I relinquish all prior claims of absolute knowledge.  All I can do from now on is stay aware, stay connected, respect God, myself, and others, and try to do the best I can.

	If you don't want to be a Christian I don't blame you, but I encourage everyone to remain open-minded, even when you're sure you have something figured out.

	I hope we aren't headed in as bad of a direction as the Bible fortells, but my current best assessment is that the world is flat, 9/11 was an inside job, the Illuminati is a real organization that runs the world with satanic worship.  I think the Awards show at the Grammy's with Sam Smith dressed a devil would have been unthinkable when I was a child, but that's where we are now.  That's what our society is broadcasting to families on TV that just want to see who won Best Album.  There's something going on here with guys trying to be girls and vice-versa.  The Nuclear Family is under attack.  I am anti-totalitarianist and I very much like freedom of choice, religion, movement, etc.   I feel I have a role to play, and although I'd accept a big one, I need to be content with doing what I can with what I can for now.

	God Bless, 

		Elam / Max

	
	p.s.  I really like some things about my journey in self-discovery.  I'm reading a novel called "Cloud Cuckoo Land" right now simply because it has "Cloudland" in it which is the name of my story I wrote about Elam, and you know what?  I love it so far.  It's a great book.  I also like that I have a favorite crystal in Lapis Lazuli, because it was found in the place called Ancient Elam and so I identify with that stone now.   I like that when I write a rap, I actually have stuff to say that is real that I believe in.  I like that I can design my own custom clothes using my symbol and colour scheme.  Black and Gold or Blue with Green.  I like that when someone hands me a paint brush and paint I know what belongs on the canvas.  I like that I have found a guiding force to drive my behavior.  My favorite thing of all is my business card I've designed.  Gold glittered poster board with my symbol sharpied on the front, and a url to my website on the back.  That is just so cool that I can hand that to people and they can immediately tell that it was hand-crafted and it's just so cool that I have a hand-crafted card that sparkles and sends you to my hand-crafted website.  So although I make many glaring mistakes, and many of them may be turned off by my writings or speeches once they look into them, at least I have a good beginning.  I know I'm only getting better.  "Start, then Learn" is the best piece of advice I ever got because I know so much just by trying things out.  My simple triangle and halo symbol has evolved into a rotating rainbow 3D perfect tetrahedron!  My symbol has evolved into a beautiful set of A.I. variations, and some of my songs have been remastered by my friend and sound truly musically delightful.  Some of my quotes pack a punch, while others falst flat.  You have to start small and try to be tall.  Even if I try to be too tall for my own good sometimes, I'm still growing.  I am forever.  I am Eternal.  I am Tree.  I am Elam.  and I love you and I hope you figure out who you are before it's too late.  

	I am a hypocrite.  I am imperfect.  I am all these things.  But I am not giving up.   I will continue to try to find out who I am, who created me, and where I'm going.  I will continue to try to help others and myself.  These videos and essays are for both of us, I hope.  Gonna go watch some porn now.  I just hope it isn't too gay.  I hope I can get a pretty girlfriend again someday.

God fucking bless, and may God forgive my soul.
