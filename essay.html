            <h3>07/2022</h3>
            <p>
               In the season finale of the latest season of "Stranger Things" the plot revolves around a character named Max.
            </p>
            <p>
                Max is used as a decoy to be attacked by "one" or I would interpret as "The Evil One" of the bible, or satan.
            </p>
            <p>
                Eleven, is the Christ-like figure of the show because she can overpower one.
            </p>
            <p>
                Max would obviously be me, although it's a girl named Maxine in the show who goes by Max.
            </p>
            <p>
                Music is the way Max can free herself from one.
            </p>
            <p>
                Therefore, I should play my guitar again and maybe write a new song to combat the devil in my own life.
            </p>
            <p>
                Sometimes I wonder what the point of this whole website is, or what it is I'm really trying to say with my blog.  But when I'm gloifying Jesus Christ it becomes crystal clear.  Jesus Christ is my king.  I desire to be by his side.  Selah.
            </p>
            <p>
                If I can bring one soul over to Christ, it's all worth it.  Even if I only play a small role in their journey to salvation.  And maybe I convince no one but myself -- even that is worth fighting for.  Self-salvation through the attempted salvation of others.  Like in AA how trying to keep others sober keeps yourself sober.  Trying to save others souls saves your own soul.
            </p>
            <p>
                I can't explain why they put a character named "Max" into the show, or why they put "The Illuminati" in Doctor Strange 2.
            </p>
            <p>
                I mean I can, but I can't sound sane at the same time, so I'll keep this essay hidden.
            </p>
            <p>
                Max wasn't in season one, but maybe God is watching what shows I'm watching, and can organize reality to speak to me in the sequels.
            </p>
            <p>
                And the Illuminati that Strange wrestles with in the sequel is an organization of his own making, just like my hypothesis of the Illuminaughty that Ali and I created.
            </p>
            <p>
                All this talk of true love in media, makes me think of Ali but also of Shaida.
            </p>
            <p>
                Ali made me promise not to date Shaida because she couldn't handle it, and I honored that request even after she broke up with me.  I desire to be able to talk to Ali again, and ask her why she did that to me, if not part of my own design to become all-powerful.
            </p>
            <p>
                Shaida accepted my linked in connection this week, and I'm eager to speak to her as well.
            </p>
            <p>
                But what version of Shaida would I be speaking to?  It's possible she is in a simulation.
            </p>
            <p>
                I essentially believe that the world as I knew it ended in 2012 when I created the Illuminati and forced Ali to break up with me.  Then there is base reality that put me in a simulation to study my behavior by sabotaging all my efforts of succcess.
            </p>
            <p>
                If I'm truly the Alpha Male, Elam Ahpla, then I would be the most valuable thing to study just by removing the girls from my life that I want.  Because if they let me get the girl, I rest.  But by continuing to put the carrot on the stick, I as the horse of the Illuminati, keep working like Boxer in Animal Farm by George Orwell.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the movie "The Eternals" the Eternal named Phastos invents the steam engine and he considers gifting the design to the humans to accelerate their growth.
            </p>
            <p>
                If this were truly how the steam engine was developed, it would explain a lot about the game of life.
            </p>
            <p>
                If it really is just humans that make the advancements in technology like engines, and computers, then I would feel inadequate as a person, but everything in my life experience tells me otherwise.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you imagine technology handed down by Gods, then that means the average human is much smarter than they think they are.  Because of course you give up at a certain point in mathematics, or chess, if you base your skill on the best so-called humans.  But if you just level yourself up you reach a new understanding of the game or craft.
            </p>
            <p>
                This world is a trick, designed by the devil to get you to think you are nothing, when in actuality, you are everything.
            </p>
            <p>
                God lets the devil do this because he wants to see which ones of his creations can see through the mist and reach their full potential.
            </p>
            <p>
                In my case, computer programming is damn near impossible, and the barrier to entry into jobs is insurmountable.  But if I simply take what I've learned and use it to create this website, I end up accomplishing greatness through progress like Ryan Holiday said.
            </p>
            <p>
                I just listened to Ryan Holiday on Joe Rogan today, and I'm more than half-way done reading "The Obstacle is the Way".
            </p>
            <p>
                The obstacle in my way is technical interviews for software engineering jobs at Google, Meta, and Amazon.
            </p>
            <p>
                But maybe that's just base reality studying my brain and putting those problems in front of me.
            </p>
            <p>
                I have a faint memory of asking Ali while we were dating what she thought of Brian.  I knew he was in her friend group in college and was waiting to get with her.  I tried to tell her this and she assured me he wasn't a threat and that she didn't like him.
            </p>
            <p>
                Now she's married to him.  Is that the matrix or is this real life?  Is true love real?  Because if it is, I think I had it with Ali enough to tell her my truth as a man that all I really wanted was her, and by having her to myself at a young age, I would never reach my potential as a male, as THE male... Elam.
            </p>
            <p>
                Danielle Montero even reached out to me to let me know that it made no sense for Ali to choose Brian Hake over me because he was a less-impressive version of myself.
            </p>
            <p>
                He looks good to me now, but I still think I could beat him in a one-on-one anything.
            </p>
            <p>
                I still haven't gotten over Ali and I'll never understand why she left me... but then again I was letting myself slip when I had her.  I used her love for me as a weapon so I could stop working out and still get to have sex with her with little effort.
            </p>
            <p>
                Maybe she left me because she knew I was going to become a loser, but didn't I warn her of my mindset?  Couldn't she have just asked me to workout more?  Or to make more money?  I would have done it in a heartbeat.
            </p>
            <p>
                Lastly, I remember her crying on the phone telling me she was going to have to end the relationship.  It was as if someone was on the other line forcing her to do it.  My own organization of the illuminati.
            </p>
            <p>
                I asked if she still loved me and she said yes, and that she still wanted to spend the summer with me, but that she wasn't going to date me the next year.
            </p>
            <p>
                I said okay, thinking I could change her mind that summer.  I still wasn't ready to break up with her, even though I was conflicted about asking her to marry me.  Marriage didn't seem to suit me.  I just knew I'd never be able to break up with her, but I didn't need anything legal saying that.
            </p>
            <p>
                The final part I want to solidy in this essay is that every time I tried to bring up our relationship in the summer, she wouldn't want to talk about it.  She wanted to just go to the beach and have a special night.  She still acted fully in love with me.  And she cried when she drove away.
            </p>
            <p>
                She didn't act like a girl ready to move on.  I don't know how she did it other than government agents in her ear helping her through it.
            </p>
            <p>
                That's my theory of true love, the illuminati, simulation reality, and Ali Jann.
            </p>
            <p>
                Ali Hake is a fake and Ali Jann is the truth.  I know she still loves me deep down.  I have notes from her saying she will always love me.  I must find her.  I don't know her cell phone number.  I'm also not ready.  I don't know which version of Ali or Shaida I'll be dealing with.  I might be dead in base reality and they both love me on the outside but the simulated versions of themselves must be approached with delicacy in this version of reality.
            </p>
            <p>
                But I love them both like slingshots.  I use one to get to the other and I would do that infinitely if I could.
            </p>
            <p>
                What am I?  Insane?  Why am I so superior at so many things and yet so unsuccessful?  I know I'm good looking.  I know she loved me.
            </p>
            <p>
                And Jessica Deam drives me crazy too.  She was so lovely and I lost her.  Why?  What am I missing besides dollars and cents?  And I feel the game is rigged against me.
            </p>
            <p>
                That is my psychosis articulated.  The strangest things.  It's enough to make me levitate like Max in the show, and be saved by Christ at the last second.
            </p>
            <p>
                I've given into the devil and watched bad porn, but God has smiled on me and is giving me another chance to redeem myself.
            </p>
            <p>
                I desire to be in His kingdom, and to learn the truth about love and the women I've loved.
            </p>
            <p>
                Will I ever find love again?  I just had a brush with love again but it's another girl I don't feel that physical connection with.  I need a 10.  Jessica was a 9.5.  Ali was a 10.  I miss her so much and I will always love her forever.  Amen.
            </p>
            <p>
                I think loving Beauty is underrated.  Beautiful girls should be celebrated, pursued, and defended to the death.
            </p>
            <p>
                I want to spend eternity with Ali in heaven.
            </p>
            <p>
                Shout out to the two girls I interacted with on the day I met XXXtencion.  My emerald girl that ran up to me on the sidewalk is the most beautiful thing I've seen since Ali.  and I think it was like Trinity coming into the Matrix to save Neo.  I love you, Ali.  You are my trinity.  Whether you're purple, green, or just your dirtyblonde self, I've never seen a more beautiful site and I could write a thousand poems for you if you'd only just let me win you back.  
            </p>

                Also, the clock rings 4 times in Stranger Things.  Her favorite number was 4.
            </p>
            <p>
                I wrote a song called <a target="_blank" href="music.html">Lullaby</a> and it is stuck at 4 views even though it's a pretty good tune and some of my views are over 300.
            </p>
            <p>
                I think that's her higher self's way of showing me she heard it.
            </p>
            <p>
                That song would have never been written if we stayed together.  That's why I think I forced her to break up with me and erase my memory so I could make better art.
            </p>
            <p>
                I think <a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/GUfk2QnUfQc">Jonathan Adampants</a> was a member of the Illuminati who was sent into my reality to deliver a message directly to me so I could find my way off of the 9/11 conspiracy path and go back to being Max.
            </p>
            <p>
                If this is all an elaborate delusion self-defense mechanism by my ego then it's quite the impressive one.  The problem with that theory is I have towers of evidence backing up the basic premise that life is a matrix and the illuminati is real and rigging the game against me.
            </p>
            <p>
                What I struggle with is that if this is my reality, what about my friends?  Do they have a new character with their name in the TV Show they watch?  Do they have true love defining their existance.  See if Ali really did just break up with me then true love doesn't exist.  I can't replace her because we were each other's first and we were madly in love.
            </p>
            <p>
                Now I'm just mad max, even I admit this sounds nuts.  But it's my truth.  It's my Asha.  It's the meaning of my life.  No one can tell me what my life is but me.
            </p>
            <p>
                Either everyone has their own reality forming around them simultaneously or I'm the chosen one and it's only forming around me, but I know that this life is a test.
            </p>
            <p>
                I already passed the first part.  I've done salvia.  I'm at least on level 2.
            </p>
            <p>
                I need to stay humble in this universe.  I need to just keep hitting the gym, complete my 12 steps, stay sober, and work for RJ's company and see if I can get some money and be self supporting again.
            </p>
            <p>
                Then I need to find a girl I'm physically attracted to and I need to date her.  But she also has to support my ideas and website and the way I think outside the box.  Or does she?  Maybe I'd be content with just beauty and protecting that beauty because beauty is sacred and must be defended by strong males.  Women are so fragile in my experience.
            </p>
            <p>
                I pray to God I will see Ali again, even if it's only in my dreams.  If this reality is all there is, and she really did just dump me and organize it so I couldn't be happy with anyone else, then she would be one wicked woman.  I know she was obsessed with Facebook and keeping up appearences.  But I also know she told me about her "one word project" and it was "Driven" and I see a sign that says "Driven" when I'm driving on the freeway.
            </p>
            <p>
                Why doesn't she just help me if she loves me so much?  I did post a facebook status humiliating her in public and she was mad about that.  Maybe I really am just crazy, but I can't even watch Stranger things without them shouting my name, "Max!" and I can't watch Doctor Strange 2 without them having a full scene on the Illuminati.
            </p>
            <p>
                Sometimes I see people and I don't want to be their king, or their savior.  That's Jesus's job.  I just want Ali.  I just want my girl.  I want Shaida, or Ashley, or either one of the Jessicas.  I miss them all terribly so.  I love beauty and providing for it and protecting it.  Maybe that's what I should do.  But money is so evil.  The pursuit of it so vain.  RJ has money.  Maybe I can work at Mad Rose and slip through the evil cracks of this rigged game and actually make some money.  Then I can find a beautiful girl and provide for her and start a family... but I'll always miss my first girl who I chose so carefully... Ali.  And Shaida is special too.
            </p>
            <p>
                God bless,
                Elam.
