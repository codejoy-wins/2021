            <p>
                Before I get into my third essay I'm going to address the first two and mention some recent updates to the site.  
            </p>
            <p>
                My first essay was about feeling powerless to stop a global conspiracy to enslave humanity and how they were using Covid as an excuse to further their agenda.  My second essay was about realizing that I don't have to play that game.  I'm going to develope myself and not let something outside of me define who I am, or what this website is.  
            </p>
            <p>
                Which brings me to my third essay.  My website is really coming together.  On the web development tab, I have a clean way to link to my past creations, like DJ Alien, which I'm listening to now.  It's a website that can play random songs.  It's fun to not know what's coming!  Chance is fun.  I like bible dice for that reason.  You never know what verse you're going to get, and I don't really believe in chance.  I wouldn't put it past an all-powerful God to be able to give you whatever verse you need.
            </p>
            <p>
                Should this essay be about chance?  I can say that believing that God can't control coincidences is wrong, but believing that God can control all coincidences is also wrong.  I think balance is key.  I've been out of balance on both sides.  Should this essay be about balance?  Probably, but I've been meaning to write an essay on Tolerance as a virtue... but that philosophy is explained in my viral whiteBloodCell video.  It had 2,000 views in the first couple days and then fell off completely.  I think Google may have removed me from their algorithm for recommended videos.  I didn't get hardly any likes or dislikes, but I had so many views and my average view time was the whole video.  It was pretty crazy.
            </p>
            <p>
                I want to discuss whiteBloodCell a bit more.  If I listen to it now, there are some parts I agree with, and other parts that I don't.  A lot of it is ego-driven, but it's also a video of me recognizing that, apologizing, and trying to come out of it.  There are also parts where I predict my own assassination.  I no longer think people are going to assasinate me.  I do not think I am powerful, important, or influential enough to merit assassination. However,  character assassination is something I wouldn't put past them.  Them is the bad guys, and I will explain who that is later.  Why kill someone when you can construct a society that will write them off as insane?  Lock them up against their will and forcefeed them medication with coorperation as the only means of escape.  I'm just going to say it.  My sister took one look at my blog and accused me of sounding like an incel who's going to shoot up a school.  First of all, in case you don't know, incel means involuntary celibacy, or not having sex only because no one wants to have sex with you.  I think that would apply to a lot of men but I also think the term is reserved for virgins, and cannot be applied to someone like myself in any logical way.  Also, the shooting up of a school, or anything, is so contrary to my beliefs I'm exspousing that it's basically just a wild accusation that can only be explained by the programming of her mind.  Somehow she's been trained to associate new ideas with mass murder.  It's a brilliant defense by the system.  A lot of these shootings on the news are fake if you look into them.  And not only do they use the fake shootings to try to seize our weapons, but they also try to make people who have different opinions out to be some kind of violent threat to society.  Nothing could be further than the truth.  I've gotten in a couple of fist-fights in middle school, that's about it.  And I would never kill an innocent person. It's just absurd.  Getting back to the whiteBloodCell video, I want to say that I was very mentally sharp at that time.  I am just now surpassing that level of mental accuity.  See in wbc, I had never had any drugs forced on me.  After that video, I began to let the views get to my head, and I thought they were going to kill me so I stopped going to sleep and that led to further delusions.  I was also out of balance with the God controlling coincidences thing, but honestly I did a lot of great stuff like walking around just helping people.  Some of the best days of my life were in that time period where I would walk around offering help to everyone I saw in any way I could and I helped a lot of people.  
            </p>
            <p>
                I was doing what Jesus would do, literally.  Then I admit I kind of lost it and thought maybe I was the second coming of Jesus.  I was going by the name Elam and I still like that name.  I think it's important to keep my own name and think I will name my son Elam if I have one.  The worst I got was thinking my ex-gf had erased my memory at my request and that I was part of a government program where all my girlfriends were told to leave me so I could pursue art. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Let me try to explain my delusion specifically because I think it would make a good movie.  I had a perfect 10 girlfriend and confided in her that I had no reason to do anything else with my life.  I saw no point in making a bunch of money.  I said the richest man in the world could offer me trillions for you and I would say no.  I thought I had the most value in the world.  I thought that all the buildings were built by men trying to have sex, and given that I had found the best sex in the world, there was no drive left in me.  This was actually a real conversation and theory that I had driving home from a sleepover party with my ex.  Where the delusion starts is that later on in my life I was coming off of marijuana use, lacking sleep, and emotionally scarred, so I thought, "What if I went to the government with my theory, and they gave me an IQ test and I was off the charts, and I made the decision to erase my memory, order my ex to break up with me, so that I could rediscover my motivation to succeed?".  
            </p>
            <p>
                I knew, at 20, if my gf had stayed with me for the rest of my life, I would never accomplish anything else.  I knew it in my bones.  I didn't fucking care about achieving anything else.  That's just the truth.  Before she broke up with me, I remember her asking about my idea I had for Amazon.com, and I basically said I didn't care anymore.  My idea was like the ability to purchase a 1 percent chance of winning an video game for $1.  That way, you get $100, give away a $60 game, and profit $40.  It's a lottery you can actually win, and it captures an audience who can't afford the game, but is willing to wager $1 for a 1% chance of it arriving at their door with free shipping.  It's a good idea but it's illegal because the government controls raffles because they're bastards.  I later pursued it a little with a website LuckyBid, but like I said, illegal.  Anyway, she left.  We also discussed me not seeing the point in working out.  I was just completely honest with her.  I had the best body around and a six pack, tan, and everything, because I was trying to get the hottest girl in town.  But after over a year of having her, what was the point of working out?  I realized I had love on my side, and was taking advantage of it.  She's not going to leave me just because I don't have a perfect body anymore, it'd be too risky for her.  But I just flat out told her how I was viewing matters.  She said, "What would you do if we broke up?"  I said I'd probably work out again and get another hot chick.  She was very upset.  "Why do those girls get to have that Max but I don't?"  I don't know.  I just didn't see the point in keeping up the effort to keep her.  What is the point?  I worked so hard to be able to get her that I wanted to enjoy her and basically rest.  Anyway, she left eventually and instead of trying hard to be irresistable again, I focused on getting her back because I didn't want to start over again with a new one.  It was pure laziness.  It was pathetic, and she saw it coming from a mile away and I basically ruined our whole relationship, as well as my relationship with basically every woman in my life.  I was honest with her during the relationship though about my personal motivations.  So in my delusion, I thought maybe she wanted to stay with me, but I had ordered her to break up with me so I could achieve something.  I also had organized a system that would remove all the girls from my life so I could focus on building something cool.  I thought Jonathan Adampants was a government agent speaking directly to me, through an audiotape that they had me find.  Anyway, it's ridiculous, and I only had this delusion for like a day, a month tops.  I hope I explained my delusion properly.  I think it's interesting how my damaged ego managed to try to repair itself by crafting a scenario where girls weren't leaving me simply because they had someone better.  One of my best friends was even more delusional, and his came from his ego and ex-gf as well.  
            </p>
            <p>
                Anyway, my mom is upset with me for not taking responsibility for my mental breakdown.  I'm sorry.  I sorry I scared you.  I was under pressure trying to find a job after coding bootcamp, and I made that video and saw it going viral, and I thought I was the second coming of Jesus.  I thought I was Elam. I thought thE LAMb of God referred to Max Jann changing his name to Elam Ahpla (alpha male in reverse) and I thought the lamb of God was a shoutout to whichever person started to go by Elam by recognizing this society needs an alpha male who fights back against this corrupt society.  I still think Elam and The Lamb of God are potentially connected.  I don't think I'm Jesus, but I do think I was onto something.  
            </p>
            <p>
                There is a war on masculinity.  There is need of an alpha male.  There is a spiritual war going on.  There is need of the second coming of Jesus.  If I'm not powerful enough to be the solution I'm at least glad that I tried.  The thing my parents don't understand is that some of the things I was "crazy" about are actually true and I still believe and they still don't.  Now that I have experience with the process of being caged as crazy, they will never get me again.  However, I still hold 90% of the same beliefs.  I have explained why some of my beliefs at my breaking point were delusional, but that does not discount 90% of them.  My parents spent a fortune on my mental health after that situation, and I am thankful for some of the treatment I received.  After getting out of my first 5150, or mental hospitalizaiton, I was still delusional, and I was taken to a sober living Oak Forest.  At Oak Forest, I made lots of friends but was still delusional about some things.  I wasn't sleeping, and hadn't for weeks, so I ran away from one of the guardians there.  I thought he was evil.  I was delusional, but desperate to get away.  I escaped and called the cops on myself trying to frame the guardian for trying to kill me, so I could have him removed from my life.  The cops just took me on my second 5150.  On my second 5150 I was still delusional.  My Dad visited me and I considered he might be God if I'm Jesus.  I was delusional, but again, not fully, just partially.  Then I get out and they sent me to D'Amore, because Oak Forest couldn't handle me.  At D'Amore I received extra care designed for the mentally ill.  I was mentally ill and that place helped me.  They put me on meds and I worked through some issues.  I forget to mention, when I got out of my second 5150, my dad was still arranging D'Amore.  I passed a mental math sanity test and escaped and got a train to my best friend's house.  My best friend wasn't allowed to pick me up because of my parents telling him not to.  I got there anyway oddly enough by following a man called Gabriel who I thought was an angel.  The guy was schizophrenic and yelling at people who I couldn't see but I yelled at them with him and oddly enough he guided me all the way to Santa Monica and was a life-saver.  So I get there and call my girlfriend at the time who came and picked me up and we went out to a date.  During the date, I couldn't read the restaurant menu because I had taken off my glasses and left them somewhere.  During my Jesus walks, I would take off my glasses and hope that God would heal my vision while I preached the gospel.  This was delusional and I was thinking, "We walk by faith not by sight".  The glasses I left somewhere by my house were brand new and like $200 at least.  I also forgot to mention that during my escape from Oak Forest I ran into a neighbors backyard and jumped into his pool and then the cops showed up!  I think I lost my glasses then, too.  Anyway it was really stupid looking back, and at the restaurant I realized that although I was free and on a date with my gf I had no choice but to beg my parents for glasses because I couldn't see.  I had lost my job I had because I was locked up while I had that job with an important presentation to parents about teaching their kids how to build robots.  I was recently named head of the department and nervous and I think that also led to the mental breakdown.  
            </p>
            <p>
                Okay, so I call my parents and say I surrender, and they put me in D'Amore and I'm ready to go get well.  So I had a good attitude going into D'Amore whereas the mental institutions were against my will so I clung to my delusion.  At D'Amore I was just interested in getting my life back to where I can pay for my life and glasses.  I realized God had failed to help me in the way I was expecting.
            </p>
            <p>
                D'Amore was ridiculously expensive and I was hellbent on getting out of there in 30 days and getting on with my life.  After all, despite the recent breakdown, I was also a talented coder with multiple degrees and recent interviews at Google, Amazon, and a gaming company.  I was also getting promotions at Sylvan Learning Center, but that was gone.   
            </p>
            <p>
                However, upon returning home, I was in a bad spot.  I had no money, and I had debt from the coding dojo, and I had no programming job to pay for my life and debts.  I also had no parental support or even part-time job support, so I had to go along with the plan of going to a place called Awakenings.  Now, to be clear, D'Amore had some fantasic therapists.  The therapists were off the charts.  I learned so much about myself and loved it.  I loved my personal therapist Chris, who said, "If I do my job well you'll never see me again or here form me again" and he has stayed true to that even though I'd love to reconnect.  He was such a great guy.  And there was Elliot, who would play chess with me.  No one could beat me at chess but I appreciated them trying to relate to me.  Then there was a woman who's name I forget.  She was the best therapist.  She was middle eastern and a Doctor I think, like Nadia.  I don't remember, but she was fantastic.  The psychiatrist however, I did not like.  I did not like to be on medication.  It's against my philosophy.  They were quick to diagnose me with Bipolar disorder, and I think Schizo-affective.  I'm sure if I walked into a psychiatrists office right now they'd say the same thing, but fuck them.  Maybe I needed a little bit of meds to calm me down, that's fine.  But they were intent on giving me a life-long diagnosis and life-long medication and I wasn't willing to accept that.  Luckily my therapist understood and we came up with a plan of how to get free of meds and I have executed that plan.  Most therapists in my experience are at odds with the psychiatrists who try to give so much medication.  Sure, you could give me a lobotomy and then I'd never go crazy again, but I'd also never be interesting again, get the picture?  Charles Bukowski said, “Some people never go crazy. What truly horrible lives they must lead.”  That quote is famous because it's true.  I'm mad they diagnosed me long-term and medicated me heavily. I'm mad that they were trying to inject abilify into my arm before I left D'Amore at 30 days and went to Awakenings.  I'm mad at the psychiatrist at Awakenings too.  I've only ever had one good psychiatrist, well maybe two.  The first and the last.  Dr. K , and Dr. Saifuddin.  Saifuddin was the woman who let me taper off the meds.  I'll talk about Dr. K another time.  That was back when I failed out of college and said 9/11 was an inside job, which it was.  
            </p>
            <p>
                Anyway, I was at Awakenings and I was trapped because I had no time to work and make money to escape this insane system I had trapped myself in becausae of my breakdown.  My breakdowns all happened within the span of a month.  But the treatment process went on for a year.  I was fine after D'Amore but had to go through Awakenings and take more drugs to be able to escape and pay for my own life.  It's hard to pay for my own life.  I've had a fulltime job in insurance for over a year and it's still hard but I'm basically doing it.  I've been off all my meds for at least a year too and I feel fine and haven't had any incidences other than this website if you want to count it as manic writing.  Good for you, you get a pat on the back for parroting what they've said is true. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The point I'm trying to make is that while under the medication I was unable to think advanced thoughts.  I was unable to code.  I was beatable at chess, although Jermaine is a brilliant player from Compton who learned chess in jail.  Still, I don't think he's 2000.  He's more like 1900 and I would lose often.  I beat him in our final games.  Under medication I was zombified and boring and unintelligent.  I had no excitement, no passion, and no vitality.  It's soul sucking.  Maybe I needed it for a bit but to give someone a life sentence of that is pure evil.  Like I said, why not just lobotomize them?  No more trouble.
            </p>
            <p>
                So I like the WBC video and I'm just now reaching that level of excitement again and you could think a crash is coming but like I said, they'll never get me again.  And, I have a job for the moment and enough work experience that I could probably get another one if something happened.  I like my job a lot.  The people are wonderful.  
            </p>
            <p>
                So I'm hoping to do a WBC Part 2 video where I share my views of my new self, where I take the good of the first video and leave out the bad, or the delusional.  
            </p>
            <p>
                See, thinking 9/11 is an inside job or that we haven't been to the moon is not delusional.  It's not the same thing as thinking your gf erased your memory.  You've been told they're the same but they aren't.  For example, if I say the Statue of Libery is a reference to the Sun God Helios, and it's actually a man, you would probably call that delusional.  However, the crown she wears, is actually representing a sun and sun rays.  Also, it was not a gift from the French Government to the US Government.  It was a statue built by French Freemasons who intended for it to be placed in Egypt, but they were turned down and America was their second choice.  It has nothing to do with the "Freedom" of America because it was offered to Egypt and is about the Sun.  So am I delusional about the Statue of Liberty?  Or do you just simply not know it's true history?  
            </p>
            <p>
                In regards to the moon landing, did you know we're supposed to believe that President Richard Nixon called Neil Armstrong on the telephone and he picked up and they had a chat while he was on the moon?  It's been over 50 years.  Do we even have the technology now to do that?  The man is using a landline, attached to radio that is somehow reaching Niel on the Moon,  and then Neil is somehow broadcasting that signal back from the moon for a crystal clear phone call.  Did Neil fly up there with as big of a satellite that Nasa has?  Did Nasa's big radio signal get picked up by anyone on earth?  It seems like bullshit.  And to actually question this or research it is not delusional; it's natural to want to know how we were able to have a landline to the moon in 1969.  
            </p>
            <p>
                My point is, although I have suffered from delusions in the past, I am not suffereing from delusions currently.  I get plenty of sleep.  I go by my own name.  I just think there is more to this world than meets the eye.  I think there are massive lies that somehow trick the massive majority of people here.  I don't believe in our democracy.  I think it's a facade and the real power is behind the scenes.  It's possibly they're not even human.  Why is it seen as delusional to think maybe it's not just people pulling off all these tricks?  My dad always says people can't pull of these conspiracies.  However, they were pulled off. So then, if people cannot do them and yet they are done, then logically they must be done by non-people.  I don't know how they do it or who they are, but I would imagine the Devil is somehow involved.  I think Christianty does a nice job explaining the veil the world is under.  I'm speaking of Level 3 Christianty.  See my blog post called, "Do you believe in God?" for an explanation of the 3 levels of understanding God.
            </p>
            <p>
                The coding dojo forgave my 25K debt because I was declared too insane to pay it off, so that's nice because now I can use what I learned to code this site, but not have to pay them. I will pay them if I ever make money coding. However, it is upsetting how much my parents spent and wasted on my recovery.  They could have paid a lot less if they had let me get out of Awakenings sooner and get a job, but hey, they did their best and I'm thankful.  At least now I'm off of meds and at my highest chess rating of all time.  If I may make one excuse I would say I didn't ask for this world, I was put in it and it is full of deception that is enough to drive a smart person crazy.  Atmosphere raps, "Smart went crazy, but where did you go?"
            </p>
            <p>Where did you go?</p>

            <h3>02/2021</h3>
    <p>My last essay was about me feeling powerless, this one is about me feeling less unelightened.
    </p>
    <p>I'm not ready to say I'm enlightened, but I think I've taken a solid step in the right direction since my last essay.  In my last essay I swore I'd stop a global conspiracy.  I've decided not to.  I don't think that's what I'm here for.  I think reality is how it is and it's not my job to get you to see it.</p>
    <p>
        I do not regret my time as a conspiracy theorist, but I do apologize for it.  I was no better than anyone else.  I was stuck in a spiderweb on the side of a rabbit hole.  I've climbed out.  I've leaving all that behind.  It doesn't mean I don't believe it; it means I've demoted it's importance.  I'm not interested in convincing you of this or that little thing.  Unless it interests you, and I can bring value to you and help you along your path, it's really not my place to try desperately to pull you out of your paradigm.
    </p>
    <p>
        If I had to paint a picture of my 20's it would be me wandering through a vast field of ditches, stumbling into them as I go, and on the other side is the word truth.  But whatever direction I go, the word truth moves to another point on the arc of circle.  I even fell into a ditch so deep I ended up in a mental institution, but at least I tried.  I'm actually proud of myself for trying.
    </p>
    <p>
        Now, I'm no longer wandering this field.  I'm setting up camp, tending a fire, and coding a website.  I am no longer interested in searching for answers outside of myself.  
    </p>
    <p>I'm no longer interested in thwarting some master plan.  I'm just going to ignore this reality's desperate attempts to get my attention.  I'm going to leave the radio off, and spent more time with my own thoughts and dreams.</p>
    <p>
        I might walk into a store with my mask off and when someone challenges me say, "Didn't you hear?  The mask manndate has been lifted by executive order.  We don't have to wear them anymore!".  I think I might get away with it since most people are dying to hear it.
    </p>
    <p>I'll have my fun, and no one can stop me.  Go ahead and kill me because I have lots of questions for God.</p>
    <p>I want this website to be about me, not some global conspiracy theory.  This isn't conspiraciesrus.com this is maxjann.com</p>

    I wish I was a better man.  I wish I was more powerful.  I wish I had more influence.  I wish I could stop what's happening.
    </p>
    <p>
    It's been 7 months since the government issued a stay at home order.  I was let go by my job due to the restrictions on businesses by the government.  The government issued two stimulus checks and I didn't get either one.   I got my job back by driving by the office to see if they were truly shutting down.  They weren't, and my boss saw me drive by, and then called me up and gave me my job back.  Months later he told me he had called because he saw me drive by and thought I really wanted my job back.
    </p>
    <p>
    I did.  I wanted my job back badly because it was my chance to form my independence and get out of the mental hospitals, residential treatment centers, and sober livings I had been living in the past year.
    </p>
    <p>
    I moved out.  I rented a room near work, and I just got a new car with the help of my parents.  I kept the job for a year which was my goal.  I enjoy it and the people I work with, and I'm glad I have earned my independence and do not have to attend daily AA meetings or therapy sessions.
    </p>
    <p>
    The company I work for just issued a mandatory mask mandate at all times.  Originally I only had to wear one while moving around, but was allowed to take it off at my desk.  The thought of wearing a mask every day all day is unbearable to me.  I left work early and I am attempting to get a doctor's note to exempt me from the new mandate.  I do not think I will succeed, but I did get my boss to allow me to put the mask below my nose so that I can breathe.  This is a small consolation prize.  Others are not so lucky.
    </p>
    <p>
    The Vaccine Mandate is inevitable.  I do not want a vaccine.  I do not trust big pharma, the cdc, or the government.  I will be fired for refusing to take the vaccine, if I'm not already fired for refusing to wear the mask.
    </p>
    <p>
    The vaccine is rushed and unsafe.  It is a special new type of vaccine called an mRNA Vaccine.  It injects genetic code into your body to trick your body into creating a virus.  The hope, or the con, I should say, is that your body will then defeat the virus and be ready for it in the future.  Most of the time, vaccines simply insert a weak or cousin version of the virus into your body, and your body fights it and learns from it.  That is how vaccines were invented and proven effective.  That is not how the experimental covid vaccine works.  The covid vaccine will mess with your genetic material.
    </p>
    <p>
    Let me ask you this question.  Would you like a rattlesnake venom vaccine right now?  A rattlesnake could end up killing you if you don't take some of it now.  Or, would you prefer to have an antidote, if you are ever bitten?
    </p>
    <p>
    Vaccines are not desirable under any circumstances.  They are dangerous.  They are exposing you to illness in the hopes that it may help you in the future.  Any side effects caused by them are not the concern of the pharmaceutical companies that made them because they are not liable in court because they bought all the politicians.
    </p>
    <p>
    They even bought the CDC.
    </p>
    <p>
    Vaccines are potentially brilliant.  If nothing else works, and you do it correctly, maybe it is the best solution.  However,  other methods should be pursued first.  Making a vaccine is an inherantly delicate process and rushing a new one into a global population could have serious risks such as infertility.  
    </p>
    <p>
    This could happen by mistake, or on purpose.  I don't trust big pharma either way.
    </p>
    <p>
    This is the end of democracy.  This is the end of freedom.  This is the adolescence of a global control system that governs everyone, all of the time.  
    </p>
    <p>
    They will not come out and say it until it is too late.  They may never say it at all.  Ask yourself, if your group was trying to take over the world totally, would you announce it beforehand or claim to be working in the world's best interests?  These people aren't shy about lying.
    </p>

    On September 11th, 2001 the twin towers were destroyed.  We were told it was by terrorists hijacking commercial planes and flying them into the tops of the buildings, causing the buildings to crumble to the ground after staying upright for a bit while the fire magically made it's way to the foundation and pulled out the bottom jenga blocks.  
</p>
<p>
    Then we declared war on terror.  We tried to catch Osama Bin Laden.  We claimed there were weapons of mass destruction and went to war in the middle east in multiple countries, killing multiple leaders, and we found nothing.  We were told we caught Bin Laden and buried him at the bottom of the ocean.  
</p>
<p>
    The war on terror, which cannot feasibly end based on the word "Terror",  caused Americans to lose their right to privacy.  We have all of our phone calls and emails recorded by the government.  They track our movements and communications.  They have thwarted exacly 0 terrorist attacks with the information they got from Americans even though that was the justification in the first place.  They have admitted it has not helped in a single example.  
</p>
<p>
    Now the pandemic.  Simulations by Bill Gates were run a couple years ago and now they have come to pass.  The world is experiencing a pandemic.  Real or fake, the impact of the government's reaction to it has been fatal.  Suicide rates are up, overdoses are up, many small businesses have collapsed due to their inability to function with the new government covid 1984 regulations.  
</p>
<p>
    Schools closed.  Church gatherings were forbidden.  Parties were frowned upon, sometimes downright illegal.  Curfews are in effect in Belgium, with drones enforcing them and social distancing.  
</p>
<p>
    I can't think of a worse world to live in than one where drones follow you at night and prevent you from touching your girlfriend or showing you face in public.  But that's where some of us are, right this very second.
</p>
<p>
    The worst part of all is the trickery and deception.  The sheep shepherding each other.  Common knowledge is that we should abide by these rules in order to save lives.  Most people agree that this will pass, and it's the right thing to do to give up a little freedom here and there, for the greater good.  Nothing could be further from the truth.
</p>
<p>
    The lockdown won't end.  They said 2 weeks and it's been 7 months.  The only way the lockdown ends is with a global vaccination agenda which will be far worse and result in infertility or genocide.  
</p>
<p>
    I could be wrong.  I've been wrong before.  I thought Jesus was real and could use me to heal this world.  They locked me up and forced me to take antipsychotic medications.
</p>
<p>
    I've been off of my meds now for several months.  I am completely and utterly sober.  I have a fulltime job, and a college degree.  I pay my taxes, and this is my opinion on the current state of affairs.
</p>
<p>
    There are better ways to combat the coronavirus.  Promoting health would be really great.  Closing fast food restaurants and things like that would be smarter than closing gyms, schools, and churches.  
</p>
<p>
    People need each other.  The idea that we should all social distance and cover our faces is ludicrous.  Hugs and smiles are good for your health, and we aren't getting as many of them.
</p>
<p>
    I may have made some religious mistakes in the past but I am not a fool. I'm a 2000+ rated chess expert with a philosophy degree from UC Santa Cruz and a coding certificate from Coding Dojo.  When you know what I know, it's absolutely terrifying.
</p>
<p>
    Big Brother is watching you.  He's making sure your face is covered at all times.  He's making sure you can't get close to anyone else or have any type of gathering. He's tracking your location.  He's reading your texts, emails, and listening to your phone calls.  He's telling you when you're allowed to go outside, and when you're supposed to stay at home.  He's telling you whether or not you're essential.  This is all real.  This is really happening.
</p>
<p>
    If humanity wants to band together and fight the spread of a contagious virus then go for it, but that isn't what's happening.  Deep down, very deep down, most people want to take the damn mask off and go back to normal, but they can't; they'd be ostracized, demonized, attacked, shamed, and refused service.
</p>
<p>
    This is really, really, really bad, and scary.  This is the end of freedom. This isn't people freely choosing to fight the spread of a virus because of how horrible it is.  This is a handful of people ordaining how we have to live, without doing it themselves.  They control the narrative and literally censor detractors off of youtube or social media and say it's because they're "dangerous".  
</p>
<p>
    The only danger here is a totalitarian Covid 1984 dictatorship.  With forced mask mandates, vaccinations, social distancing, and curfews.
</p>
<p>
    How would life under the Taliban be any different?  Surely there are sizable similarities here.  And ask yourself, which direction we are going?  Contact tracing will be the new excuse.  Look at China's social credit system.  It's pure evil, and we're too stupid to prevent it from happening here.  
</p>
<p>
    There is no leadership.  The best we have is Joe Rogan who just signed a $100 Million Dollar deal and is very unlikely to push against anything right now.  
</p>
<p>
    Elon Musk has been on record saying we gave away our liberty too easily but he can't do everything.  He's not a politician and that's unfair to ask of him.  
</p>
<p>
    I wish I could help the people.  I want so badly to but it's an enormously uphill battle, and I've started from the bottom of a ditch.  
</p>
<p>
    I can hardly help myself.  I tried helping a girl banker with her mask mandate and it ended up backfiring where the next day my company issued a mask mandate.
</p>
<p>
    Now we have a new president too.  It's a treacherous time to be alive.  It truly is.  Covid 1984 is a false flag.  It's too perfect for these governors and pharmaceutical companies to be happenstance.
</p>
<p>
    I guess I'm just along for the ride.  I will never give up though.  I will try to stop this global conspiracy, even if I'm wrong, even if it takes my sanity away.  I will try to stop it.
