            <p>
                We're at the point in the season where the statistical rank of a player starts to have more weight.
            </p>
            <p>
                I was incredibly impressed by Swift in the Rams game.  As you can see from this picture, the competition was stiff.  But Swift would make the defender miss time and time again and rip off big plays, almost willing his inferior team to victory.
            </p>
            <p>
                I will never again doubt a bad situation in fantasy.  When you have juice, you make plays.  Swift has it.  And the lions haven't had a back like this since Barry Sanders.  He looks like he isn't going anywhere as a top flight RB.

            <h3>Two Girls One Cupp - Ernie McMillan</h3>
            
            <p><span id="orangefirst">C</span>ooper Kupp has quite the stat log this season.  Every single game has 10+ targets and 10+ fantasy points.  He has 30+ fantasy points 4 seperate times already.  He is the number 1 fantasy wide receiver which was broken by Chase, before Kupp got the chance to play in the afternoon.  Oh and Debo Samuel?  He used to be the 1 Overall, so basically Ernie's team is beyond comparison.</p>
            <p>
                You can put 125 points against Ernie and still get blown out.  I haven't seen a run this dominant in the history of our league.  Sure, I had a good 10 team league with a great keeper, but this team is just unreal quality for a 12 team league.
            </p>
            <p>
                Not only did he pick up and play Tua but Tua must have got the memo because he put up an overall QB1 Finish to help Ernie's team win another $50.  Incredible.  I'm honestly open to advice from Ernie.  How the hell did you do this?  How are you doing this?
            </p>
            
            <h3 class="question">QB Tua Tagovaloa</h3> -- QB1?

            <h3 class="impact">RB Darrell Williams</h3> -- nice cuff
            <br>
            <h3 class="impact">RB Darrel Henderson Jr</h3> -- This offense is so good and the defense makes him run the ball with the lead.  There's no denying the value here.
            <br>
            <h3 class="impact">WR Cooper Kupp</h3> -- Unbelievable start to the season
            <br>
            <h3 class="impact">WR Jamar Chase</h3> -- Looks so good I wish I drafted him
            <br>

            <br>
            <h3 class="impact">WR Debo Samuel</h3> -- Really good flex
            <br>
            <p>
                Can this team stay healthy?  Because Darrel Henderson gets banged up a lot, and Debo Samuel runs like a man possessed and forgets to protect himself.
            </p>
            <p>
                As it is though, this roster is almost impossible to stop.

            <h3>Sandusky's Soldiers - Chris Kazmer</h3>
            <p><span id="bluefirst">C</span>hris's whole team was on BYE and he still won</p>
            <p>
                Granted, Sven put up -6 from his defense and flex, and if he didn't start either of them he would have won by 5 points, but that's neither here nor there.
            </p>
            <p>
                This was an off-week for Chris basically, and he got in the win column.  I think there's no reason to move this down.  However, I'm putting Ernie in Tier 0 all by himself, and Chris in Tier 1.

            <h3 class="impact">WR Mike Williams</h3> -- Wow... I got to see it in person
            <p>
                Godwin proving why he's a must start.  Diggs will heat up.  Chris has Great Players on Great teams with the bills, cowboys, and bucs.  Also the Chargers and Raiders give him some top-tier options in Waller and Williams.
            </p>
            <p>

            <h3>Hurts so Good - Devon "Deandre" Silber</h3>
            <p><span id="bluefirst">J</span>aylen Hurts is the QB2 on the year</p>
            <p>
                Devon's team has Dalvin Cook, and Deandre Swift, and when you consider that Cook has some 40 point games in his toolbox, and Swift and Hurts are already top flight fantasy options, you really have to wonder if Devon can win the ship this year.  He made it all the way last year, and it's hard to say if this year he's any worse off.  Diontae Johnson and Keenan Allen are both talented legit ppr options.  Goedert has gained value without Ertz.
            </p>
            <p>
                McKissic provides valuable RB Depth and Mattison is a great cuff.
            </p>
            <p>
                Sutton is a big body.  Then he's got Josh Jacobs at a good value.  It's hard to argue with this team as a tier 1 team right now.  He has all the ingredients.
            </p>
            <p>
                Jaylen Hurts is so bad that the game is basically over in the 3rd quarter and he gets all his points rushing in the 4th.  It's really quite embarassing from an NFL fan perspective but Devon has to be loving it at this point.
            </p>
            <h3>QB Jalen Hurts</h3> - Jalen Hurts my brain!!!!  Worst Game ever = 25 points

            <p><span id="bluefirst">J</span>oe Burrow just showed the world what he can do</p>
            <p>
                He can outshine Lamar Jackson and grab first place in one of the best divisions of the NFL.        
            </p>
            <p>
                The Bengals have finally brought all the pieces together.  They have a decent defense and O-line.  A non-moronic head coach, a star QB with a star RB and WR and some great pass catchers at wideout and TE to compliment him.
            </p>
            <p>
                I played Devin this week and I would have lost to your grandmother this week with all my injuries but hats off to devin and his ridiculous start to the day.  All of his Wide Receivers caught TD's on the opening drive of their game and the points kept coming.
            </p>
            <p>
                Devin's draft pick of Mike Davis was a doozy but he made up for it with Harris and Harris did to the Jets what we've all been waiting for him to do -- go off.
            </p>
            <h3>QB Justin Herbert</h3> -- I bet Dkazz $5 Burrow outscores him on season
            <br>
            <h3 class="quesiton">RB Miles Sanders</h3> -- Ankle!
            <br>
            <h3 class="impact">RB Damien Harris</h3> -- I think Harris is an every week play considering how lousy Davis and Sanders are right now.  At least Harris has flashed.
            <br>
            <h3 class="impact">WR Davonte Adampants</h3> -- Last Dance...
            <br>
            <h3 class="impact">WR DK Metcalf</h3> --Dkazz Metcalf... I miss having him on my team.
            <br>
            <h3 class="question">TE Evan Engram</h3> -- Smart pickup and play
            <br>
            <h3 class="impact">WR Terry Mclaurin</h3> -- Scary Terry doesn't like his own nickname.  WR1 Problems.
            <p>
                Last week was a dud for Dkazz, but this week his entire team poppep off.  Credit to him for having two star quarterbacks so he can play Burrow if Herbert's on BYE.  This also gives him 2 for 1 trade flexibility.

            <p>
                Starting Hardman over Williams shows me that you don't really know what you're doing.  Hardman has to be an NFL draft bust at this point in the season and Williams looks like a good play moving forward.

                That 18 points from Hubbard is very key when your guy McCaffery goes down.  That's an example of genius Justin.  Justin is like a fool with a genius mind, or a genius with a fools mind.  I actually relate to that.  It's not easy being clever.  If it was easy, everyone would do it, as Tyrion said in Game of thrones about being drunk.

            <p>
                Montgomery being out is really not his fault, and the fact that he plugged in Pollard and got 14 is really impressive, even though Gaskin got 30+ randomly.

                This team has potential but has a glaring hole at quarterback and no path I can see to filling it.  It's very clearly not a Tier 1 team and I put it in Tier 2 as in noticably worse than the other teams in Tier 1.

               Great week from Tim, living up to Tom Brady's standards finally.
            </p>
            <p>
                Great job with Fournette this week.  The Brady/ Fournette combo is super valuable right now because at least one of them explodes when the Bucs offense is putting up 35 points per game.

                Hopkins and Theilen back in business, and Mike Evans had a rough week on someone else's team.  Nice job, tim.  I'm proud of you.

                Even in PPR leagues, Henry is a fantasy monster.
            </p>
            <p>
                When he was a rookie, I knew this would happen if they just gave him the rock and built the team around him.  Because he's such an NFL running back.  He's just a man amongst boys.  And he belongs as the centerpiece of a punch you in the mouth offense that beats you by demoralizing you slowly and then taking your head of like a Mortal Kombat fatality.
            </p>
            <p>
                They showed a graphic during the Monday Night Game and it showed his YPC this season by quarter.  It starts at 2 yards per carry and then doubles each quarter.  By the 4th quarter he's averaging 8 yards a carry and putting away close games.
            </p>
            <p>
                The only way to stop him is to blow them out in the first half.
            </p>
            <h3>QB Matthew Stafford</h3>
            <br>

            <br>
            <h3 class="question">RB Chris Carson</h3> -- Always hurt, and Sven didn't pickup Rashad Penny with Collins listed as questionable.
            <br>
            <h3 class="impact">WR Brandon Aiyuk</h3> -- Coming off the bye should be more involved
            <br>

            <h3 class="impact">WR AJ Brown</h3> -- Big 2nd half
            <br>

            <h3 class="impact">TE Kyle Pitts</h3> -- Pitts finally went off
            <br>

            <h3>WR Leviska Shenault</h3> -- I feel bad for Sven that he has to start a Jaguar.
            <p>
                Sven lost by one this week to a Byepocalypse Chris, because he started Sterling Shepherd who was questionable and ended up not playing,  All Sven had to do was throw in anyone else and he would have won.  These wins matter a lot.  You can put up 130 and still lose.  You have to grab the W when you're opponent has all his players on BYE.  Power rankings factor in the skill of the players but also of the manager.  Sven clearly is not committed to winning a fantsy title, and therefore it will elude him.

            <p>
                I have gone from the Developer to the Disaster, because I didn't draft enough RB Depth and then I had two catastophic RB injuries.
            </p>
            <p>
                I threw Josh Gordon into my lineup this week because I knew I would need 50 to win.  He got me 0!  So there's that.

            <h3 class="question">RB Demetric Felton</h3>  - I chose to cuff Hunt with Felton, as I think he's got nice receiving skills and looks explosive, but it was the Johnson show on Thursday.

            <h3 class="impact">WR Antonio Brown</h3>  -- Twisted his ankle just now, lucky me!
            <br>
            <h3 class="question">WR Devonta Smith</h3> -- Jaylen Hurts made only 1 NFL throw last game and it was a Dig route to Devonta.  Do it more Jaylen.  All you do is run on every single damn play.
            <br>
            <h3 class="question">TE Rob Gronkowski</h3> -- I don't know man, will he play?
            <br>
            <h3>WR Kadarius Toney</h3> -- I don't know what to expect from this guy but he certainly is giving me OBJ rookie year vibes and moves like no one I've even seen with this weird jab step dead leg that defenders fall for every time.
            <p>
                The reason the Eagles don't run is that every time they call a pass play it turns into Jaylen Hurts running for 1 yard out of bounds, barely getting the corner or throwing it at the last second to a double covered receiver.  He's HORRIBLE.  Super frustrating landing spot for such a stud young WR.
            </p>
            <h5>Notable Bench Players:</h5>
            <h3 class="question">Michael Thomas</h3> -- A hole
            <h3 class="question">Trevor Lawrence</h3> -- I think he's decent
            <h3 class="question">Odell Beckham Jr.</h3> -- Very frustrating fantasy option.
            <br>
            <p>
                I was going to move my team way down but Kamara messed around and put up a WR1 day at RB.
            </p>
            <p>
                I say my team is Tier 4 right now just because it has serious problems at RB.

                Wow, everything went right for Charlie to get this dub.  He started Marquez Calloway over Julio Jones and would have lost if he hadn't done that.  Still, not crazy about half of the players starting on this team, and most his stars are disappointing this year.  Allen and Taylor are the lone bright spots.

                Austin Ekeler is of course responsible, back to his overrated ways, just when you think you can trust him, he goes on BYE and leaves you to pick up the pieces.

                Although I said Swift was great in a bad situation, Gibson's production has to concern you.  Is it injury?  Is it him?  Is it the QB?  Consecutive terrible games from your early second round pick is not good at all.

            <h3 class="question">TE George Kittle</h3> -- I think he's hurt with 0 points.
            <p>
                Nice job with Zach Ertz, of course when I pay 25 dollars for him he gets me one point but then he immediately skyrockets in value when I drop him.
            </p>
            <p>
                Lockett's gonna be really really bad, and Tee Higgins just isn't cutting it this year.  I don't know how I pulled off the semis with Higgins and Aiyuk last year.  They are awful this year.
            </p>
            <p>
                With Rodgers, Ekeler and Gibson you have a nice start to a great team but your wide recievers are wack.    Your depth is uninspiring, and you should be dealing a Zach Moss or a Singletary to an RB-needy team in exchange for upside wide recievers like Kadarius Toney.  And why is he on my team?  He should be on your team.  You need to drop average bench players and hold onto lottery tickets if you ever want to have a great team.
            </p>
            <p>
                I'm sorry.. I don't hate you.  I just hate your team.
            </p>
            <p>
                I could honestly rank my team at dead last but I think my team has better long-term prospects then these teams below me if my team gets healthy.
