                <h2>Life is a beautiful journey | Illuminati Master Plan</h2>
                <h4>Life is a beautiful journey</h4>
                <p>
                    I was researching robotics news today and it made me realize how incredible human consciousness is.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The problems I wrestle with every day are highly individualized.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm kind of on a self-improvement hiatus.  It's kind of like I'm constantly downtalking myself for being short of my own expectations.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I often project 20 years into the future and see what can go wrong but life is really long and I'm only 30 years old.  I will probably have many monumental moments in my future and it's a lot of pressure to become the man I wish to be in those situations.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Something happens to me and I often think about how it could have gone better if I were better.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It's an interesting choice I have of whether or not to self-improve or chase the girl.
                </p>
                <p>
                    And what would make me truly happy?  Putting up chess teacher fliers and getting a new student?  Going on a date with a pretty girl?   Playing in a chess tournament?  Learning something new in code?
                </p>
                <p>
                    I don't know but I'm also kind of down to sit back for a little bit and celebrate what I've achieved already.  I'm very happy to be able to play the guitar and chess and call of duty.  I'm happy with a lot of what my life is.  I just wonder what it could be, but sometimes the beating myself up for not doing it is counter-productive.  Maybe by letting back for a bit I can reevaluate my perspective.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This blog in my opinion has gotten too self-centered.  I think it's natural for me to bring my own experiences into it but I think initally I was setting out for it to be more enjoyable or educational for others.  Now it's kind of become self-therapeutic.  However, I would like to talk about vaccine passports as restaraunts near me.
                </p>
                <h4>Illuminati Master Plan</h4>
                <p>
                    I heard that restaurants in LA county require your proof of vaccination at the door to eat inside.  Even the vaccinated have to be annoyed with this.  The unvaccinated are not only annoyed but also cannot eat there!  Ridiculous.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This is the one place I can talk uncensored because I basically own it, but I'm finding myself censoring what I'm about to say, but I won't.  I think the covid pandemic does not exist as presented to the population.  We'll use the term Illuminati to simplify a scenario where one group leads all groups interwovenly.  I think the Illuminati made the covid-19 virus in a lab and then they released it in Wuhan China in a world wide false flag.  The Chinese government took swift authoritative action and eradicated it but it was allowed to get everywhere else including America.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    Then, in America, the CDC and some scientists came out with astronomical death projections from this new virus on the loose. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Americans were told this was so serious the best thing to do would be to stay at home and not ask questions for 2 weeks and shut down all businesses.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When we agreed, they said, "Can we please have one more week?"
                </p>
                <p>
                    We agreed again.  Then it's been about 3 years since and only gotten more authoritarian, although it does ebb and flow.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Okay, so now that the Illuminati has shut down the entire world at the drop of a bat, they then issue a worldwide dress code to our faces. These stupid, surgical masks for regular people.
                </p>
                <p>
                    And then they police them like mad!  Like you cannot get your hair cut mad.  These restricitons were so draconian looking back on them that I still can't really believe it.  This was all done in the name of a problem they themselves created in a lab on purpose.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Then, for the next step in their master plan, the Illuminati rushed in the new Covid Vaccine.  The Illuminati has members in the presidency, the CDC, Big pharma, and everything in between.  So, they rush and approve this emergency usage of a new type of mRNA vaccine and not only that, but they mandate everyone do it.  They're hellbent at vaccinating all of us, children too.  So they basically want a completely controlled docile population incapable of communicating, leaving their homes, seeing faces, plotting and overthrowing the government, or even just socializing and having fun.  They want slaves.  They want slaves and they want to own the blood in their veins and the neurons in their brain and they also want to control their mRNA and DNA.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The evidence of an overaching authority on this planet is overwhelming.  The Illuminati control all major elements working in concert to carry out this insansely fast vaccine mandate for kids to go to school.
                </p>
                <img class="picfloat" src="static/img/endgame.jpeg" alt="chess">
                <p>
                    What's their endgame?  Some say depopulation, or sterilization.  I don't lean that way personally.  I tend to think I don't know what they're going to do next.  I'm having trouble guessing.  I've also heard the vaccine leaves the arm and can travel through the whole body so it could go to the brain and alter some things the government wants different in 80% of people.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The problem with thinking that this is a concerted effort because of the deadly nature of this virus is that you're not acknowledging who created the virus and why.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The response to the virus, not the virus itself, but the response to the virus by world governments has been nothing short of earth-shaking.  Many of history's greatest moments involved deception.  The public is the last to know.
                </p>

                    I'll leave you with a song from Will Smith's daughter.  Also, if you believe me about the Illuminati Master Plann and don't know what to do, I'd give Jesus a second glance.

                    I don't know if what he's saying is true but I certainly don't want to take it and I don't to give away the password to my rna.  Like I guard that with my life.  I'm not signing up for a spike protein made in a lab from this crooks.  It's so wild that this is going on.  They are injecting children.  People are getting booster shots although probably some are coming to their senses.

                    It's crazy to me how radical it is to just take your chances without a vaccine or a mask.  It's called breathing the air and being human.  I think the vaccine, if poison, is slow acting.  That way, they can have most the people survive it while they get everyone to take it.  Like a pirate giving poison wine to his crew to steal all the treasure for himself.

                <h2>Self-Love</h2>
                <p>
                    I love myself, I accept myself, I forgive myself.  I'm proud of myself.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I work hard, kick ass, and take names.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I entertain my fantasy league.  I sell insurance.  I spit conspiracy theories and I write songs and play chess.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Today I went to the gym at night in my sweatshirt and slides because it's comfy.  Then I went swimming and took a jacuzzi.  It was nice.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I am going to be nicer to myself.  Although I think I could do better, it's important for me to accept myself during the process of improvement.  I really want a scale to weight myself and see if I'm losing weight, and I also want a blender to make smoothies.  Peace out !

                <h2>Cabin in the Woods</h2>
                <p>
                    I went to a Halloween Party in a <a target="_blank" href="https://www6.f2movies.to/watch-movie/the-cabin-in-the-woods-19171.2519669">cabin in the woods</a> over the weekend
                </p>
                <img class="picfloatsmall" src="static/img/alone.JPG" alt="alone">
                <p>
                    It was very fun and a nice way to get away from my own thoughts.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm lucky to have such a great group of friends that we can do fun things with as adults with money.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Renting a cabin and splitting the rent for a weekend is an awesome time.  Next time, I would like to bring a girlfriend with me.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If I can have a dating profile with fun pictures like this, instead of lonely selfies, and if I can hit the gym a bit more, instead of hitting the candy section of 711, I should be able to get some more dates, and actually find a girl I can take to cool events like this.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Life is long.  I'm proud of myself for working through everything I've been through mentally.  Ya, I got scarred, Ya I gave up and ya I went crazy.  But I'm still here.  I'm still me.  I'm not done with life.  I just have to shake off the "story" I've been telling myself about myself and start a new one.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Each month of this blog is a fresh start for my thoughts, personality, and focus.  This month I want to focus on clarity.  Just seeing through bullshit and taking sensible steps toward my desired life.  I'm going to have my actions, and mind join together on a common purpose.  I'm going to work hard, and move closer to who I want to be.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I want to be a better, more reasonable man.  I'd like to be humbler, but also more confident.  I'd like to stop doubting myself.  I have no disability,  but sometimes I act as if I do with my body.  It's hard to explain but I feel like I doubt myself and feel like I'll make a fool of myself with my body.  I'm not comfortable with my body.  It's not how I learned to be.  I used to like having my shirt off around people, but now I'm embarrassed.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    Still, I got some Yoga in over the weekend with my friend's girlfriend and I will try to focus on that this month.  I will focus on my body and stretching it and working it out properly.  Happy body, happy mind.
                </p>
                <p>
                    That's my new slogan I will try out this month.  Happy Body, Happy Mind.
