                <h2>Cabin in the Woods</h2>
                <p>
                    I went to a Halloween Party in a <a target="_blank" href="https://www6.f2movies.to/watch-movie/the-cabin-in-the-woods-19171.2519669">cabin in the woods</a> over the weekend
                </p>
                <img class="picfloatsmall" src="static/img/alone.JPG" alt="alone">
                <p>
                    It was very fun and a nice way to get away from my own thoughts.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm lucky to have such a great group of friends that we can do fun things with as adults with money.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Renting a cabin and splitting the rent for a weekend is an awesome time.  Next time, I would like to bring a girlfriend with me.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If I can have a dating profile with fun pictures like this, instead of lonely selfies, and if I can hit the gym a bit more, instead of hitting the candy section of 711, I should be able to get some more dates, and actually find a girl I can take to cool events like this.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Life is long.  I'm proud of myself for working through everything I've been through mentally.  Ya, I got scarred, Ya I gave up and ya I went crazy.  But I'm still here.  I'm still me.  I'm not done with life.  I just have to shake off the "story" I've been telling myself about myself and start a new one.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Each month of this blog is a fresh start for my thoughts, personality, and focus.  This month I want to focus on clarity.  Just seeing through bullshit and taking sensible steps toward my desired life.  I'm going to have my actions, and mind join together on a common purpose.  I'm going to work hard, and move closer to who I want to be.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I want to be a better, more reasonable man.  I'd like to be humbler, but also more confident.  I'd like to stop doubting myself.  I have no disability,  but sometimes I act as if I do with my body.  It's hard to explain but I feel like I doubt myself and feel like I'll make a fool of myself with my body.  I'm not comfortable with my body.  It's not how I learned to be.  I used to like having my shirt off around people, but now I'm embarrassed.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    Still, I got some Yoga in over the weekend with my friend's girlfriend and I will try to focus on that this month.  I will focus on my body and stretching it and working it out properly.  Happy body, happy mind.
                </p>
                <p>
                    That's my new slogan I will try out this month.  Happy Body, Happy Mind.
                </p>
