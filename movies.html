            <p>Our Overlords have determined that the Movie Theaters are too dangerous for you, but not before I got the chance to see Tenet.</p>

            <h3>Tenet</h3>

            <h4>7/10</h4>
            <p>This is one of the most difficult movies to review.  I enjoyed watching it in theaters.  Too much of it doesn't make sense.  Why does The Protagonist go so far out of his way to save the bad guy's wife if he is dealing with a platonium level threat as a secret agent?  There is not enough of character development to justify his strange decisions to basically risk the fate of world on saving the bad guy's wife.  That doesn't even scratch the surface on difficultly understanding this film.  The bad guy is getting help from the future to destroy the past.  Why?  I've seen it 3 times and I still don't know why.  Also, the whole going inverted and then driving a car and it explodes so you get hypothermia thing?  No thanks.  However, this movie does certain things very well like a breathtaking action packed opening scene along with the smooth way The Protagonist wins fist fights.  The inversion thing is cool initially, it's only very frustrating on the rewatch when you're hoping to truly understand this movie.  It has it's moments, and is very ambitious.  I was going to give it a 4/10 because it's closer to a disaster than a masterpiece but I had so much fun watching it the first time that I have to give it a 7.</p>
