    <p>The computer doesn't like my rook sacrifice but it's probably my favorite move ever.</p>
    <p>Funny enough, the computer actually recommends a4, sacrificing a pawn, and if knight takes then it recommends sacrificing the rook, because then the knight isn't able to defend the king.</p>
    <p>So it's not that it didn't like to sacrifice, it's that I didn't sacrifice enough!  Computers are savage.  I knew the knight could defend but I thought I had such a nice position in that variation that he wouldn't be able to defend.  Sure enough, he makes one mistake and then it's basically over.  By the time he blunders the rook his position is completely lost.  I had cut off all escape for his king and was ready to check him on multiple squares where he couldn't block, so the queen came out to try to stop that, leaving the rook hanging, and then everything fell apart.  I've been battling in the 2000s enough now that I feel comfortable that that's my playing strength.  Not sure what to do to keep climbing other than physical strength to keep my focus. </p>
    <p>I have worked for Educhess and Chess Wizards.</p>

    <p>My rating of 2051 is on a scale from 100-3000.  3000 has never been reached by a person, but some machines are that strong.  I remember when my goal was to hit 1500.  I'm way further than I thought I could get.  In the 2000s is where the Grandmasters live, the best players in the world.  Magnus Carlsen, the world champion with the highest rating ever is 2862.  However, a 2600 player could get the chance to play him in a tournament because there are not a lot of players in that range.
    </p>

    <p>  2500 is required to become a Grandmaster.  I guess that's my ultimate goal in chess.  

    </p>
    <p>2300 is called a Candidate Master, maybe that'd be more realistic.  I don't know.</p>
    <p>At one point I set a goal of 2000 and now that I've achieved it, instead of setting a new one, I'm choosing to enjoy my achievement.  I rarely play because I don't want to lose and fall below 2000.</p>

    <p>I got this rating in classical time controls which means like a normal game of chess with a lot of time on the clock, I am not as good at speed chess.  I like to enjoy the position and search for the best strategy.</p>

    <p>My favorite players are Mikhail Tal and Bobby Fischer.  Of the players who are alive I like Kasparov, Magnus, and Firouzja.</p>
    <p>My favorite way to follow or learn chess is with the GothamChess YouTube Channel.</p>
    <p>Here are some tutorials I made:</p>
