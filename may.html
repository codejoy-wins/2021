                <p>I have been corresponding with another youtuber <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvaC9mCDhii4t3fxLkyHqQQ">Armunn Righ</a> who <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCA3tbHe2O7q0ryWamx696fA">Quantum of Conscience</a> recommended.

He saw my <a target="_blank" href="recruitment.html">blog post</a> and reached out to me.  I then asked him if he would do a guest blog post for my site.</p>

                    <p>
                    After we got in touch, as I came across an article he wrote about the “System's
Recruitment” contemplation video, Max Jann of maxjann.com invited me to make a blog
post for his website. I accepted and thank the honour.</p>
<p>

As I contemplated on it, I realized that it was an opportunity to summarize much of what
was previously addressed in a more condensed manner (as much as we can condense that
which, through words, needs so many of them to even attempt at a glimpse of
realization). It is fitting to do such a review as I still am in the mournful wake of Bu's
passing (to better understand Bu's importance and significance, please refer to the
contemplations named “Walk of Life”, “I lob tchiken” and “Droopy eared Angel”).

«The world is a vampire, set to drain» - this is the statement that begins the song “Bullet
with butterfly wings” from the band Smashing Pumpkins. Not that I am a fan, particularly,
but this is one of those lyrics that could serve as an example for a transmuted spell, that
was cast on the communication channels of pop culture. Certainly, the idea behind it was
the promotion of the depression, demoralization and internal strife that so characterized
Emo culture. This culture was but one among many others that served as a hook to
capture any post-children (or adolescents, in other words) that were going through the
conflict stemming from the realization that what was conveyed and offered to them in
childhood had nothing to do with adult life. To capture them, first they were sold fantasies
as children, then thrown head on against reality's wall, only to then offer identification
frameworks, examples, settings, entire cultures. This would not only prevent the individual
from using that conflict of facing reality to contemplate and perhaps connect to an
ineffable source, a Truth only realized but never touched, beyond the fog of the world, but
also to be packaged, catalogued and stored into an array of acceptable identification. By
acceptable, one must understand that it is meant an identification that feeds the world
itself. So, going back to the lyrics I mentioned, the intent behind «The world is a vampire,
set to drain» was not a warning against the obvious vampire of the world, but a promotion
of helplessness in the face of it and a preparation to become its feeder by becoming
paladin of the wrong master and going against the wrong enemy. And what is the wrong
master? Anything that is not Life and Love. And what is the wrong enemy? Anything that
would remove the individual from that vampirized state. Nevertheless, despite this, those
lyrics do state a fact that can be transmuted to a higher truer sense and, therefore, be
read as a warning that is moral in nature. It is, ultimately, how we read them, what we
internally make of the spells given to us, that constitute our deeper Moral choices.
</p>
<p>


As was stated in the contemplation “System's Recruitment”, that Maxwell wrote about in
his blog post, the idea of the world is to recruit the Living, that is, to convince the Living to
generate food for the world of fog or the vampire. How is this done at a deeper level?
Sure, we all can understand that someone who starts off pure-hearted can then be
tempted into accepting gradual changes that will deviate them from that purity and even
turn them into evil enforcers. Yet, at a deeper level, how is that done? What happens
beneath the visible surface of cause and effect?
</p>
<p>



I will use two metaphors to try to describe it and none are particularly new, but they do
not need to be, however, they complement each other.
</p>
<p>


One is that the vampire feeds not directly from the Life of the Living (as it cannot touch it
or it will kill it, like the sunlight of vampire myths) but from the transformation, or predigestion if you like, of that Life into a tumour form, a decaying and death-aligned mass.
So the Living is convinced, by strife and shock, to willingly use some of their Life to
generate a dead mass that can be consumed by the vampire (or bacteria and fungi, as is
used in that contemplation). By doing so, the world can then feed a whole food chain of
cult priests, not only at the manifest human level, but also mental levels (for more on this,
refer to the contemplation named “Cult of Sin”). Basically, a parasitical lifeform that
convinces the all-important host to enact behaviour that feed it and protect it – very
prevalent in nature. In fact, parasitism is nature's favourite lifestyle because it is the most
successful in it. This can only be explained if nature's mind (so to speak) is already also
taken over by a parasitical identification, or, otherwise, if nature itself is part of the original
parasite. That is a debate that is quite fruitful to have, in terms of circumstance
perception. If one is so inclined to it, I would suggest reading the Acts of Pilate, a part of
the Gospel of Nicodemus, apocrypha, whose Part II serves as a most dramatic and
interesting depiction of the Christian . <a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150705090754/http://folk.uio.no/lukeb/books/apocrypha/
Gospel_of_Nicodemus.pdf">“Harrowing of Hell”</a>
</p>
<p>


Another metaphor is that of the mirror or mirrors; and this metaphor is more helpful to
understand the importance and significance of our internal alignment. If we come to
realize and accept that we have a Life or a treasure that the parasites need us to use in a
certain way for their survival and proliferation, then we need to understand how this
process works and also, most importantly, how the parasites come to be in the first place.
Imagine that each of us have a mirror that is also simultaneously a window that looks out
onto the world and whose window throws onto the world our internal state of affairs. The
world itself is a mirror too, so it reflects the type of image cast by our window back at us.
Then, our individual mirror potentially reflects that same image. If the two mirrors are
aligned and are reflecting that image, it will create an “infinity mirror” effect, which is
basically a reflection that is endlessly replicated to infinity, even though it becomes smaller
and less defined the farther it is from the original image.
<img class="picfloat" src="static/img/mirror.jpg" alt="mirror">
</p><p>
Therefore, if we can be convinced to project onto the mirror of the world a parasite or
food for it, it will replicate in this way, as the individual mirror and the world mirror will
reflect each other and our cast image. This is why it is important to first look internally, to
observe everything around us as a manifest image of something within, so that we can
purify the image we project, at least, or even be able to one day not project at all and
leave the shadow world, at best (for more on this, please refer to the contemplation
“Shadow Play”).
</p>
<p>
These two metaphors were discussed in both “Metaphors of Tumours” and “Mirror”
contemplations.
</p><p>
In summary, «the world is a vampire, set to drain» yes, but we were the ones who
projected it and keep projecting it as it is. There is an interlinked code in Christianity (but
not in the bible) that is very useful in that regard: the seven deadly sins. These are
interlinked because the “sins” feed each other too and they change our inner color (refer
to the contemplation named “Sin and Forgiveness”). However, if one can become alert to
the influence these have within us, it will be already like opening a curtain and letting the
sunlight hit the vampire of the world, because the shadow reflected on that infinity mirror
effect and the production of those tumours it feeds on is halted.

                    Wow.  I really like the mirror analogy. And the tumours.  Any time cancer analogies are brought up I think of <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/user/lukasig">Jonathan Adampants</a> "The Healing Begins Now" Audio series where he talks about the cancer-consciousness. Another thing I like about this guest post is that he talks about looking inward, and fixing what's in here, in order to fix what's out there.  Realizing that the hell around us is a reflection of our internal state is very wise indeed.  All my favorite thinkers have that in common.  Jesus said,
