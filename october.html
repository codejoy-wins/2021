                    I was listening to Christopher Hitchens today and he said religion is like a death cult, because in order to believe it you have to long for death, and subscribe to the idea of an apocalypse.  You have to consider all human progress as something to be discarded and started over.
                </p>
                <p>
                    He also pointed out that religions can satisfy the human need for obedience and slavery, essentially.  In light of a cosmic God one can only be a cosmic serf of sorts.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In my own personal experiennce I was at my most happiest when I wasn't particularly religious nor was I philosophical.  I was 20 and happy with the world and my place in it.  I didn't long for it to be over and to be placed in some sort of heaven.  And I didn't long to be told what to do by cosmic laws either.  I was content with making my own judgements and decisions.  And of course, church was always seen as a drag.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Neil Degrasse Tyson also said today to me in that same video, "The Universe is knowable".  Do not try to ascribe what you don't understand to the mystical or magical.
                </p>

                    Recently I was watching a QOC video where he points out how impossibly fast Google's search results are, and he did have some excellent points, however, he had a basic misunderstanding of how search engines work.  He thought it was searching the whole web in less than a second and returning results.  In reality, I think it works more like a search engine working around the clock and organizing everything so that when you type in a search it just filters the list it already possesses.  It doesn't start from scratch.  It just goes to the section of it's library that you need.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I don't want to point at things I don't understand and make foolish claims about it.  I'm not taking magic off of the table either.
                </p>

                    Matt from Quantum of Conscience has stopped researching thoroughly.  As he points out, you never get anywhere or convince anyone, so it must be pointless.  He says it (reality itself) will give you what it wants you to chase.  You certainly end up in a pointless loop.  So it's not worth investigating what kind of poop it is if you know it's poop.  Just stay away.  You don't have to do a chemical analysis. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    But it's got me thinking.  I'm disappointed in believing in God.  I'm disappointed in myself.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    I went to West Hollywood and had a birthday dinner with some friends and we went out to the bar and there were a lot of pretty girls and I talked to a lot of them.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I came home empty handed.  The best interaction I had was with the prettiest girl there.  She had a boyfriend who came in with her but I told her when she was alone that she was the prettiest girl there.  She really was a stunner.  She believed me and was nice to me.  Later I went back to talk to her again and officially ask her on a date but she said she couldn't because of the bf.  I then asked for her advice on what I can improve on so I can get a girl like her.  She asked me to hold her drink and then unbuttoned my shirt.  I had it buttoned up because I had no undershirt because I had gotten it wet earlier when I got out of the jacuzzi.  She said to stay authentic and try again.  There was nothing she could really tell me.  I already know the answer.  It's just hard work I am having trouble getting myself to do.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Another girl told me to be persistent, which I thought was interesting.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The trouble with cocaine is you think you're a success when you're on it, and you feel like a failure coming down.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The trouble with porn is you are experiencing what it's like to be with a woman, while at the same time distancing yourself from getting a real woman.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Drugs and shortcuts don't work.  There's no easy way to get anything worthwhile.  Is that God?  Is that Evolution?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Should I curse existence for dangling things in front of me that I cannot currently have, or may never have?  Or should I thank God for giving me something I desire and can work toward achieving.  Would it be easier if all girls were hot and horny and thought I was dead sexy?  Or is it the perfect balance?                
                </p>
                <p>
                    It's such a fundamental desire, that it's very hard to not consider myself a failure, turning 30, single and alone.  On the other hand, I'm glad I'm single, and only want to spend my time on high-quality women.  Extremely high-quality woman.  I really only had eyes on that one girl, and I'm not really capable of giving it my all with a consolation girl.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    On the bright side, at least I'm still young enough to turn things around.  I also do not lack the confidence to approach and try to get a girl like that.  I am unsuccessful, but at least I have the ability to succeed.

                    When I see an internship for Insomniac Games which made Spiderman and Ratchet and Clank, I read the job requirements and realize I'm not qualified.  It really stinks.  It requires C++ or a math or physics major or computer science major.  I know C# and have a coding bootcamp certificate.  Not quite there, but I'm also not completely far off.  My life has probably never been more in the balance.  I could resign to failure and long for an afterlife, another life, the end of the world.  Or, I could strive to be better, learn more and understand more about the world, and to participate in actively helping that world grow.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In that vein, religious beliefs seem like death, and realistic beliefs seem like life.  But of course it's more complicated than that, and Jesus said quite the opposite.  But even Jesus I have a problem with right now.  Suppose I get with a girl and she's Christian and she likes me back.  What if she doesn't have sex with me because we're not married or something?  Isn't that just basing a serious decision on fable?  There is no hard evidence that God exists and doesn't want you to fuck.  And if he did, why did he make it so damn alluring?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Tonight, Thunder roared and the sky cried, and it felt like God weeping for losing one of his Christian believers, and I thought about why people thought Thor would be angry at me for discounting him and his hammer.

                    I look at the way Ozark portrayed the Pastor, and I think it was purposefully to make Christians seem insane, which actually lends credibility to religion in my eyes.  However, Game of Thrones does an excellent job of showing how realistic these fake religions can get.  Everyone just goes along with the Lord of Light or the Seven, and it all seems perfectly normal.  It fits right in with our religions of the past and present, and yet it's being make-believe forms no noticable seperation from our own.

                    I'm not ready to throw Jesus out completely, and I'm even less ready to throw out conspiracies or the Mandela Effect.   But,  I will not fall into lazy thinking of calling things I can't explain magic.  And I will not curse this world and long for the next.  I will also not take my values from some outside source.  I will do what I think is right.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My experiences recently have given me a lot to think about and there's multiple ways to interpret it in both positive and negative ways.  I'm not trying to teach you anymore, I'm more interested in just getting what I want and learning how to get it.
                </p>

                    I need a better desk and that's what I'm going to get.
