                <img class="picfloat" src="static/img/notime.jpg" alt="bondgirl">
                <p>
                    That's the new bond girl.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I went to the Chargers Browns game today and I saw James Bond tonight.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm beginning to wonder what's the point of this blog.  It used to be I thought I had something to say, something to teach.  But now I feel like I've been so bad at getting what I want that why should anyone listen to me?  Not only that, but what if I'm wrong about Jesus and God or conspiracy theories?  Then what would this blog be?  </p>
                    <p>
                        I had to get a negative test for covid within 72 hours of entering sofi stadium because I'm unvaccinated.  This added stress but it was worth it.  I got to see the Browns and Chagers put up 90 points.  
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When you are behind your computer screen and not out in the real world, it sounds worse than it actually is.  I was able to see the game with my dad and have fun even though I'm unvaccinated.  It was quite the inconveniece to get tested within the time frame given my insurance but at least it was possible.  
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If you read the official rules of Sofi stadium they say you have to wear the mask at all times when not eating or drinking, but really once you get in the front door everyone takes their masks off.  Life is good for a lot of people out there.  They are blissfully unaware of any incumberance on their life.  I dig that.  Because their radar doesn't even go off unless they're being actively restricted from having fun, whereas my radar is constantly going off.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        So it's not that big of deal.  The world is still free.  No bombs went off or anything crazy, and I got to see my favorite team play.  Then I got to see James Bond.  And James Bond wasn't feminist propaganda like some trolls might suggest.  It was a great movie.  Maybe these events people go to really are just artists trying their best to entertain or venues trying their best to be safe.  Maybe God is made up and Jesus isn't the Son of God. But.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        But, there was this one thing.  In the plot of the Bond Movie, the villain is using DNA identifying nano-bot precision poisoning to kill certain people without collateral damage.  He kind of has a kill switch on certain targets via nanobots and poison.
                    </p>
                    <img class="picfloat" src="static/img/bond2.jpg" alt="bond">
                    <p>
                        My conspiracy alarms started going off.  If they put the idea of nanobots going into your blood and manipulating your DNA or communicating your DNA to a center that can then target you, if they put that in a movie everybody laps it up like "oh yes that makes sense I get that.  Seems believeable"  Wilful suspension of disbelief.   But then if a conspiracy theorist says the vaccine has nano-technology in it that's potentially dangerous or in the hands of the wrong people then that's somehow insane or crazy.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The way it works in the bond movie is that once they have your DNA, they can kill you with a toxin that only targets your DNA group specifically.  So if you're in a party and they spray the air, only you and your family dies.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This made me think... They don't have my DNA.  They don't have nanobots in me most likely.  By abstaining from the vaccine I'm not giving them that chance or power over me.  However, in the Bond movie, the premise is, it's enough to have the nanobots in my dad or mom.  My dad and mom both got vaccinated.  So with this bond theory applied to reality then that means that my DNA might as well be targeted if necessary because the bots in my mom and dad can give the recipe for the dust that will kill me and only me and my family whenever they want to.  It sounds ridiculous I know, but think of the national security benefits to having a killswitch on everyone by virtue of mass vaccination.  Every conspiracy theorist is going to have at least one family member gullible enough to get vaccinated.  They have the killswitch on everyone.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Imagine a Car chase where a bad guy has a hostage.  The cops throw in a special gas in the car.  The gas kills the bad guy because he has a certain DNA it's designed to kill.  And the hostage gets away unharmed.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Or you could spray the air and kill everyone except the people with their DNA on the exempt list.  You could accomplish mass genocide with this bond villain technology.  Now is that a genuine theory from a real writer just trying to entertain us?  Or is that a real illuminati plot to take over the world and we are just allowed to glimpse it for whatever reason?  Is it a coincidence that the vaccinations are MRNA and the bond villain stuff is doing kind of a similar thing?  Is the writer trying to tell us something?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Anyway, I trip about girls sometimes but I just saw a full stadium of them and they're all gorgeous.  I'm sure I'll find one for me again eventually.

                    I was listening to Christopher Hitchens today and he said religion is like a death cult, because in order to believe it you have to long for death, and subscribe to the idea of an apocalypse.  You have to consider all human progress as something to be discarded and started over.
                </p>
                <p>
                    He also pointed out that religions can satisfy the human need for obedience and slavery, essentially.  In light of a cosmic God one can only be a cosmic serf of sorts.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In my own personal experiennce I was at my most happiest when I wasn't particularly religious nor was I philosophical.  I was 20 and happy with the world and my place in it.  I didn't long for it to be over and to be placed in some sort of heaven.  And I didn't long to be told what to do by cosmic laws either.  I was content with making my own judgements and decisions.  And of course, church was always seen as a drag.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Neil Degrasse Tyson also said today to me in that same video, "The Universe is knowable".  Do not try to ascribe what you don't understand to the mystical or magical.

                    Recently I was watching a QOC video where he points out how impossibly fast Google's search results are, and he did have some excellent points, however, he had a basic misunderstanding of how search engines work.  He thought it was searching the whole web in less than a second and returning results.  In reality, I think it works more like a search engine working around the clock and organizing everything so that when you type in a search it just filters the list it already possesses.  It doesn't start from scratch.  It just goes to the section of it's library that you need.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I don't want to point at things I don't understand and make foolish claims about it.  I'm not taking magic off of the table either.

                    Matt from Quantum of Conscience has stopped researching thoroughly.  As he points out, you never get anywhere or convince anyone, so it must be pointless.  He says it (reality itself) will give you what it wants you to chase.  You certainly end up in a pointless loop.  So it's not worth investigating what kind of poop it is if you know it's poop.  Just stay away.  You don't have to do a chemical analysis.

                <p>
                    But it's got me thinking.  I'm disappointed in believing in God.  I'm disappointed in myself.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    I went to West Hollywood and had a birthday dinner with some friends and we went out to the bar and there were a lot of pretty girls and I talked to a lot of them.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I came home empty handed.  The best interaction I had was with the prettiest girl there.  She had a boyfriend who came in with her but I told her when she was alone that she was the prettiest girl there.  She really was a stunner.  She believed me and was nice to me.  Later I went back to talk to her again and officially ask her on a date but she said she couldn't because of the bf.  I then asked for her advice on what I can improve on so I can get a girl like her.  She asked me to hold her drink and then unbuttoned my shirt.  I had it buttoned up because I had no undershirt because I had gotten it wet earlier when I got out of the jacuzzi.  She said to stay authentic and try again.  There was nothing she could really tell me.  I already know the answer.  It's just hard work I am having trouble getting myself to do.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Another girl told me to be persistent, which I thought was interesting.
                </p>

                    The trouble with cocaine is you think you're a success when you're on it, and you feel like a failure coming down.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The trouble with porn is you are experiencing what it's like to be with a woman, while at the same time distancing yourself from getting a real woman.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Drugs and shortcuts don't work.  There's no easy way to get anything worthwhile.  Is that God?  Is that Evolution?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Should I curse existence for dangling things in front of me that I cannot currently have, or may never have?  Or should I thank God for giving me something I desire and can work toward achieving.  Would it be easier if all girls were hot and horny and thought I was dead sexy?  Or is it the perfect balance?                
                </p>
                <p>
                    It's such a fundamental desire, that it's very hard to not consider myself a failure, turning 30, single and alone.  On the other hand, I'm glad I'm single, and only want to spend my time on high-quality women.  Extremely high-quality woman.  I really only had eyes on that one girl, and I'm not really capable of giving it my all with a consolation girl.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    On the bright side, at least I'm still young enough to turn things around.  I also do not lack the confidence to approach and try to get a girl like that.  I am unsuccessful, but at least I have the ability to succeed.

                    When I see an internship for Insomniac Games which made Spiderman and Ratchet and Clank, I read the job requirements and realize I'm not qualified.  It really stinks.  It requires C++ or a math or physics major or computer science major.  I know C# and have a coding bootcamp certificate.  Not quite there, but I'm also not completely far off.  My life has probably never been more in the balance.  I could resign to failure and long for an afterlife, another life, the end of the world.  Or, I could strive to be better, learn more and understand more about the world, and to participate in actively helping that world grow.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In that vein, religious beliefs seem like death, and realistic beliefs seem like life.  But of course it's more complicated than that, and Jesus said quite the opposite.  But even Jesus I have a problem with right now.  Suppose I get with a girl and she's Christian and she likes me back.  What if she doesn't have sex with me because we're not married or something?  Isn't that just basing a serious decision on fable?  There is no hard evidence that God exists and doesn't want you to fuck.  And if he did, why did he make it so damn alluring?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Tonight, Thunder roared and the sky cried, and it felt like God weeping for losing one of his Christian believers, and I thought about why people thought Thor would be angry at me for discounting him and his hammer.

                    I look at the way Ozark portrayed the Pastor, and I think it was purposefully to make Christians seem insane, which actually lends credibility to religion in my eyes.  However, Game of Thrones does an excellent job of showing how realistic these fake religions can get.  Everyone just goes along with the Lord of Light or the Seven, and it all seems perfectly normal.  It fits right in with our religions of the past and present, and yet it's being make-believe forms no noticable seperation from our own.

                    I'm not ready to throw Jesus out completely, and I'm even less ready to throw out conspiracies or the Mandela Effect.   But,  I will not fall into lazy thinking of calling things I can't explain magic.  And I will not curse this world and long for the next.  I will also not take my values from some outside source.  I will do what I think is right.

                    My experiences recently have given me a lot to think about and there's multiple ways to interpret it in both positive and negative ways.  I'm not trying to teach you anymore, I'm more interested in just getting what I want and learning how to get it.
