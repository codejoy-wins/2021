            That was a business plan generated by Google's Bard based on my idea and prompt.  Here are my closing thoughts.
        </p>
        <p>
            I could also get Older people who aren't comfortable with technology to invest their money into A.I. Tools so I can be the Liason between the A.I. and the person.
        </p>
        <p>
            They tell me what they want and I use A.I. for them and give them the results.
        </p>
        <p>
            Initial Business Plan to get the ball rolling:
        </p>
        <p>
            Approach local small businesses and ask for $117 startup fee.
        </p>
        <p>
            Conduct an initial interview of what the company would want A.I. to help with
        </p>
        <p>
            Return a week later to present to them a Binder of what we've already generated for them with the initial $117
        </p>
        <p>
            Give them a list of A.I. Products that they want that are available and the prices
        </p>
        <p>
            Provide them with amazing Midjourney text-to-image art depicting their business they can use for marketing
        </p>
        <p>
            Show them A.I. generated videos advertising their business.
        </p>
        <p>
            Generate for them an A.I. generated website for their business.
        </p>
        <p>
            Keep them notified and on waitlists for upcoming A.I. products so they can be the first to take advantage of the rapidly changing landscape for business during the A.I. revolution.
