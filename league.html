                    Here is Trevor's podcast for week 1
                </p>
                <p>
                    Also want to mention nice trade by Tim and Justin.  I think it helps both teams.

                <h2>Shake and Bake</h2>

                <p>
                    Boys, week 1 is practically upon us.  And once the bullets start flying, everything changes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Suddenly, all the offseason narratives fall away, and these narratives that plague rankers throughout the industry will make you curse yourself for over-analyzing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    On Thursday night, you'll remember, Tom Brady is good at football.  Rob Gronkowski is good at tight end. Antonio brown is good at receiver.  Everything else is noise.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I can't wait for Odell Beckham Jr. and the Browns to take on the Chiefs in Arrowhead.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As for our fantasy league, I'm dying to see who Justin and Trevor drop, assuming they fill their lineup and fail to swing a 2 for 1 trade in the next 24 hours.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Will Chris's team live up to the hype?  Will Devin's triple wide receivers pay off?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Fantasy football is just a game.  Devin understands that. He won the title because he made the right moves at the right time and ended up with Justin Jefferson basically filling the hole in his roster that was Julio Jones last year.  I think with the way Jamar Chase has looked, if there's a Justin Jefferson this year, he's on my team and his name is either Devonta Smith or Jaylen Waddle
                </p>
                <p>
                    This is the moment of truth.  I'll never forget week 1 Leveon Bell making one of the best runs ever against the browns and I knew I made the right keeper pick.  Or Tyreek hill backflipping in the endzone and I knew I got a 4th round steal.  Or Metcalf last year catching a bomb on atlanta.  Who will explode for your team?  What studs and duds will dramatically declare themselves?  I remember Alpert's draft pick of Gronk looked genius with a 3 TD performance on primetime back when Alpert was in the league and Gronk was in his prime.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Who's going to go off and be the 4th round steal like my Tyreek and Metcalf picks?  Here are my picks for week 1 superstars you're gonna be kicking yourself for not drafting.

                Who's going to fall flat on their face and make you regret all that draft capital you spent on them?  Here are my top candidates to disappoint
            </p>
            <p>
                Before I show you, let me tell you something.  You know when the weeks over and you glance at the other games in your league and see some of the pitiful performance of certain nfl players that were started in fantasy?  What do they have in common.  Narrative.  There is always a reason.  "Oh, I see why you started that guy.  The other guy got hurt and he was expected to be the starter"  Or, oh with so and so situation this player should benefit.  Unless it's blatant absense of talent at a certain position, most duds come from narrative driven projections of something that player isn't actually good at doing.  Like Irv Smith giving you zero when Kyle Rudolph isn't playing, or stuff like that.  Sometimes, it does pan out, like David Montgomery without Tarik Cohen last year, but beware that narratives will cause more duds than studs in my opinion.
            </p>
            <p>
                Without further ado, here are my picks for duds in week 1 and the season beyond
