                <h1>Call of Duty: Cold War 9/10</h1>
                <p>This game is getting better and better.  They keep releasing new weapons, maps, and zombies maps all for free.  They also balanced some of the weapons like the MP5 and buffed some of the bad guns so I think it's a lot of fun now.  The zombies mode is super fun and I love the multiplayer team deathmatch mode.  Even the scorestreak system is cool because it discourages camping because if you die your scorestreak does not reset</p>

                <h1>Pokemon: Sword and Shield 8/10</h1>
                <p>This game would be a 10/10 with a difficulty setting.</p>
                <p>Unfortunately, as it is, I already beat the game easily and have to brainstorm on self-imposing ways to make the game more difficult.</p>
                <p>The game is gorgeous for a Pokemon game and does scratch the itch that only pokemon games can reach.  You start from nothing, and soon develop a power hitting squad of 6 pokemon with unique skills to help you in any battle.</p>
                <p>A lot of the annoying challenges of previous games are fixed in this game, however, those challenges ended up making the games more difficult, and now, with them all gone, it's too much of a breeze.</p>
                <p>For example, You no longer need to worry about one of your pokemon knowing cut or surf.  You can even remember moves you've forgotten at pokemon centers.  All of these changes are welcome and convenient but unfortunately the difficulty is so low that the entire game becomes too convenient. </p>
                <p>The Graphics and Story are both great.  Seriously, this game would be perfect if it wasn't so damn easy, and I can't stress that enough.  The game even warns you when a trainer is about to send out a new pokemon, and asks if you want to switch.  That is absurd!  Luckily you can turn that off but setting the battle style to "set" so it goes back to the age old pokemon battle where you're caught in a type disadvantage and have to waste a turn if you want to switch pokemon.</p>
