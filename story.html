            <h1>Hunter the Hunted</h1>

            <p>
                There was a man walking briskly down an alley between tall buildings at night clutching his shotgun.  He heard some trash cans rattling in front of him and sped up his pace, aiming his sawed-off shotgun in the direction of the noise.  A spider the size of a cat jumped up at him from behind the trash cans and he shot it in mid air and it was destroyed.
            </p>
            <p>
	The man reloaded.  He kept walking, kept listening, and aiming his shogun in the direction of the noises of cat-sized spiders scurrying about the alley.  Another jumped at him and he shot it in midair again.  And another the same way.  He was hunting them down.  Then he reached the end of the alley and turned the corner onto the street.  There was a giant spider the size of a car, with hundreds of cat-sized spiders beneath him scurrying toward the hunter.

<p>
	The hunter turned around and ran, his coat swaying in the wind.  He threw down a fire grenade that stuck to the ground and glowed yellow, then orange, then red, then BOOM!  Several of the cat-sized spiders chasing the hunter were exploded into smaller spiders.  Only the silver bullets from the shotgun could prevent them from multiplying upon death.

	The hunter sprinted to a fire escape and climbed up it.  The spiders easily scaled the wall in pursuit.  The hunter pulled out a grappling gun and shot for the roof, he was just high enough so that the grapple reached the rooftop of the tall building.  He started rapelling up with tiny spiders on him now, tearing his coat.  He got up on the roof, threw off his coat, spun around and fired two quick blasts of his sawed-off shotgun.  The spiders died, and the Hunter was no longer the Hunted.
