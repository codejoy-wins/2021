                That's all Aaron Rodgers needed to drive the length of the field for a walk off winning field goal.  He found Adams twice over the middle, spiked the ball, and fist pumped triumphantly.
            </p>
            <p>
                I think we're witnessing something special with the play of Rodgers and Brady, and I wouldn't be surpised if they met in the playoffs.

            <p>
                The Rams look like they could go 20-0 because their offense is legit with Stafford, Mcvay, and Cupp, and their Defense has always been legit.  Imagine if they had Cam Akers.

                Odell Beckham Jr. is my favorite player on my favorite team.  Last year, I gave away my farm and firstborn daughter for OBJ in a trade, only to have OBJ go off for 40 points and then tear his acl shortly after.

                It wasn't all gravy though, it's kind of frustrating watching Baker try to get OBJ the ball.  They've never really clicked.  However, I think this year it might happen.

                Hunt is devestating to have on the same team because Hunt drives are actaully more successful than Chubb drives.  When Hunt's in the backfield, the D/St doesn't know if it's run or pass, so he catches them by surprise. With Chubb, they can stack the box on first down.
            </p>

Also, if Justin Tucker doesn't nail that 66 yarder and make history I lose.  But guess what?  I drafted Tucker in the 11th cuz fuck what the pros say.  And I traded a second round pick starting rb on the cheifs for a backup RB because fuck what the pros say.  If I win it all, it will be a collective F U to the industry.  I'm just doing me, and man I'm enjoying it!</p>
            <p>
                Alvin Kamara and Kareem Hunt at RB make me happy.  I simply love the way they play.  They're both very similar in that they can run up the middle or run routes.  They have great hands, balance, and similar running styles.  Hunt's a little more get upfield with anger, and Kamara is more Le'Veon patient.  But I love them both.  With Kyler then them, the top of my lineup is hard to argue with.
            </p>
            <p>
                My receivers are a work in progress.  I believe AB can come back strong and I think Gronk is a pleasant surprise and a must start.  Meanwhile Michael Thomas is eyeing a return after the Bye and Waddle can fill in for the time being.

               The reason this team is so highly ranked is because of the 1-2 punch at running back.  Najee and Mixon provide extreme ppr value and a great floor with great upside every week and they dominate touches out of the backfield for their team.

            <p>
                It happened.  Devonte Adams and DK Metcalf both went off at the same time.  The Eagles are such a disaster that Miles Sanders has limited value right now but these receivers are all extremely dangerous in a PPR League.  And running back scoring is at a historic low, so it's a good year for zero RB, but I can't put this team ahead of teams that have serious RBs, because it's a lot easier to find studs at WR throughout the season.  Devin's gonna be stuck with Sanders, Harris, and Mike Davis.  Yikes.  But Herbert looks like the Rookie of the Year in his second year, and Burrow is a great QB2.  Weakness is TE and RB, but can his QB and triple threat WRs take you down?  Yes they can.  Any given Sunday.             
            </p>
            <h3>QB Justin Herbert</h3> -- I bet Dkazz $5 Burrow outscores him on season (not looking good for me.)

Get a black quarterback or if he's white make sure he's a hall of famer or mvp candidate.

            <h3>QB Ryan Tannehil</h3>
            <br>
            <h3 class="question">RB Christian McCaffery</h3> -- uh oh
            <br>
            <h3 class="impact">RB David Montgomery</h3> -- First RB to get 100 yrds rushing on Rams in a year
            <br>
            <h3 class="impact">WR Justin Jefferson</h3> - Jefferson should steal back the spotlight

            <h3>TE Jared Cook</h3> -- Meanwhile Gesicki had a great game.

            <h5>Notable Bench Players</h5>
            <h3>WR Jarvis Landry</h3>
            <p>
                There's still time. Trade me for Fields.  You need a high upside QB play.
            </p>
            <p>
                He can't get any worse.

            <h3>Team Eight - Michael Mckenna</h3>
        <div class="texzt">
            <p><span id="first">M</span>ichael's team picked Austin Eckeler and you know what?  Good for him.  Not my style.  but it's Michael's style.  And he's a top 5 RB right now I think.</p>
            <p>
                Antonio Gibsons 75 yard screen to the house was SPECIAL.  Go watch the highlight and then picket outside the OC's house for more receptions.
            </p>
            <p>
                See my intro on Rodgers, that dudes a baaaaad man.
            </p>
            <h3 class="impact">QB Aaron Rodgers</h3> - MVP, still has Adams
            <br>
            <h3 class="impact">RB Antonio Gibson</h3> - Sublime with the ball
            <br>
            <h3 class="question">RB Austin Eckeler</h3> - temporarily an RB1 until his little body gives out.
            <br>
            <h3 class="impact">WR Tee Higgins</h3> -- I love me some Tee Higgins but Chase looks better.  He just straight up looks better.
            <h3 class="question">WR Tyler Lockett</h3> -- Tyreek Hill Lite (boom/bust)
            <br>
            <h3 class="impact">TE George Kittle</h3> -- Looks fantastic
            <p>
                This is a good squad actually.  Just some question marks at WR and some unsustainable production from Eckeler.

            <h3>In Gibson We Trust - Sven Svennefiord</h3>
            <p><span id="bluefirst">S</span>ven's team has incredible talent</p>
            <p>
                This team lost because in week 3 he played Sterling Shepherd over Brandon Aiyuk.  That's called overthinking it.  Aiyuk is a monster.  One of the best rookie wide receivers I've ever seen.  And you benched him.  I get it.  Trust me.  Everyone told you to do it.  But they don't have him, you do.  And you have to trust your draft and just start your WR2 that you drafted.
            </p>
            <h3>QB Matthew Stafford</h3>
            <br>
            <h3 class="impact">RB Derrick Henry</h3> -- Sometimes he's the best.
            <br>
            <h3>RB Chris Carson</h3>
            <br>
            <h3 class="impact">WR Brandon Aiyuk</h3> -- Where was he!?
            <br>

            <h3 class="question">WR AJ Brown</h3> -- potential injury
            <br>

            <h3 class="impact">TE Kyle Pitts</h3> -- Bad statline cuz Atlanta is garbage
            <br>

            <h3>WR Leviska Shenault</h3> -- I feel bad for Sven that he has to start a Jaguar.
            <p>
               This team looks awful but I'm telling you Aiyuk and Brown and Henry are absolute destroyers in fantasy.  Stafford is looking absolutely incredible so Sven has reason for optimism moving forward if AJ Brown can get healthy and he can stop benching his best player Aiyuk.

            <h3>Coronel Mustard's Myster Men - Charlie McMillan</h3>
            <p><span id="first">C</span>harlie's team is at the bottom of my prestigious rankings</p>
            <p>
                Josh Allen went off but this team still got smacked up bad by Chris.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Colts offense is ugly so that really hurts Jonathan Taylor.  Also, Nyheim Hines is one of the most athletic players I've ever seen, so that's also not good for Charlie.
            </p>
            <p>
                You can't hang your hat on TJ Hockenson.  You can get away with him, but he's no hat-hanger.
            </p>
            <h3 class="impact">QB Josh Allen</h3> - Goal Line Beast
            <br>
            <h3 class="impact">RB Jonathan Taylor</h3> - Bad QB play but good on tape
            <br>
            <h3>RB Kenyan Drake</h3> - good option with Jacobs toe hurting
            <br>
            <h3 class="impact">WR Calvin Ridley</h3> -- He can go off. I love Ridley, just not more than Hill.
            <br>
            <h3 class="impact">TE TJ Hockenson</h3>
            <br>
            <h3 class="question">WR DJ Chark</h3> -- Too many relevant WRS in Jaxonville.
