            <p><span id="first">J</span>ames Conner just dropped 40</p>
            <p>
                During the draft, I remember Devin turning to me in like the eight round, "Should I grab Jonnu Smith here?"
            </p>
            <p>
                "No", I said seriously.  "You should grab a running back".
            </p>
            <p>
                We look at the top available running backs..  
            </p>
            <p>
                "James Conner?"  Devin asked me
            </p>
            <p>
                "Nah, I'd probably go with a different running back (offer something obscure)"
            </p>
            <p>
                "I'm going with Conner" - Dkazz
            </p>
            <p>
                Devin had the wisdom to seek my counsel, but also the discernment to reject the lousy part of it
            </p>
            <p>
                He landed James Conner and now that Edmonds is hurt, and Kyler is banged up, and the Cardinals are somehow still the best team, it goes through Conner.
            </p>
            <p>
                Conner was already a star in his role getting goal line carries.  He did enough to earn a start in Devin's lineup before exploding.
            </p>
            <p>
                I thought he looked good even before he had truly shown it, but I rejected him in trade offers, as I'm sure many of you did.
            </p>
            <p>
                But at least I got to keep the gift that keeps on giving with OBJ.

            <h3>Two Girls One Cupp - Ernie McMillan</h3>
            
            <p><span id="orangefirst">C</span>ooper Kupp has quite the stat log this season.  Every single game has 10+ targets and 10+ fantasy points.  He has 30+ fantasy points 4 seperate times already.  He is the number 1 fantasy wide receiver which was broken by Chase, before Kupp got the chance to play in the afternoon.  Oh and Debo Samuel?  He used to be the 1 Overall, so basically Ernie's team is beyond comparison.</p>
            <p>
                You can put 125 points against Ernie and still get blown out.  I haven't seen a run this dominant in the history of our league.  Sure, I had a good 10 team league with a great keeper, but this team is just unreal quality for a 12 team league.
            </p>
            <p>
                Not only did he pick up and play Tua but Tua must have got the memo because he put up an overall QB1 Finish to help Ernie's team win another $50.  Incredible.  I'm honestly open to advice from Ernie.  How the hell did you do this?  How are you doing this?
            </p>
            <p>
                After his first loss in what seems like Eternity, it's anyone's game again.  But he still has an overwhelming advantage.
            </p>

            </p>
            <p>
                He has Cam Akers on his roster!  I didn't even know that was a thing and he's done that multiple times to me this year.

                Devin's team keeps improving... and he's getting Saquon Barkley?  He might win it all, for the second year in a row, only this time it's skill.  No one can call his bold strategy luck when every expert recommends taking a running back early including myself minus the part about me being an expert.

            <p>
                Timmy's trades this year have caused the evaporation of the middle class.  There are the towering riches of Ernie's Chris's, and Devin's teams, and then the rest of us just forking over assetts like Allen freaking Robinson, Mike fucking Evans, and Saquon God Damn Barkley!
            </p>
            <p>
                Tim somehow still has running backs but we'll get into that later.

            <p>
               Andrew swung a trade because he had fab to spend, an rb depth piece to sell, and a good record so he can wait for MT to become a thing.

                The only problem with this team name is that Dak isn't an adjective..  It can be , like a "Dak" pass.  But "Dak" lives?  There's only one Dak Life.  Unless he's reincarnated.  That must have been what Chris meant.  Moving on, this team is the best below 500 team I've ever seen.  Really solid lineup with a strong flex and above average QB and TE, this team should still make the playoffs and be a playoff powerhouse no one wants to play.

                With David Monntgomery back in the picture after the BYE, Justin defintely has the record and the playmakers to make a playoff push, however, he needs a freaking quarterback and probably a new tight end.

            <h3>WR Jarvis Landry</h3> - - What a boss

            <p><span id="first">T</span>im's team is on the up and up.</p>
            <p>
               Tim's season crashed and burned but boy was it fun to watch
            </p>
            <p>
                Great Draft from Tim combined with Novice level management has resulted in a miraculous RB combination of Left for Dead Leonard Fournette and Michael that guy on the jets Carter.
            </p>
            <p>
                Both of whom are balling out of control.
            </p>
            <p>
                Tom Brady does that too.  Then you got the Waddle experiment.  The great Waddle experiment getting a solid 10 primetime points.  You got Thielen who's always good but Hopkins ain't playing and you haven't subbed him out yet so that's not good.

            <h3>Obi-Wan Jakobi - Sven Svennefiord</h3>
            <p><span id="bluefirst">S</span>ven's team is in disarray</p>
            <p>
                Henry, the glue, is gone.
            </p>
            <p>
                Sven throws in Hines and gets like 20 points.  I love Hines.  The Colts are a great team man.  Great backs.  JT looks like he'll lead the league in rushing without Henry there.
            </p>
            <p>
                Aiyuk is going to come on strong.  I love this fantasy roster and wish it had more success.
            </p>
            <p>
                I think the problem with this roster is Sven went with Carson fairly early, and although he managed to back him up with other seahawks, Carson always gets hurt and the Seahawks cannot run without him.  It's a problem so bad that Russ wants out of Seattle.  It happens every year.  Their offense is just screwed without Chris Carson, even though he's not THAT good.
            </p>
            <p>
                They just cant get any good RB Depth.
            </p>
            <p>
                So that backfield limited your upside all year.  Also just kind of Bizarre production from AJ BROWN and AIyuk but that's what you get for taking a WR early.  Sometimes it's better to just invest in backs early and then find the flyer WRs that end up outproducing guys like ARob.

            <br>
            <h3 class="impact">RB Derrick Henry</h3> -- 3 TDs, 29 carries.
            <br>
            <h3 class="question">RB Chris Carson</h3> -- Always hurt, and Sven didn't pickup Rashad Penny with Collins listed as questionable.
            <br>
            <h3 class="impact">WR Brandon Aiyuk</h3> -- Coming off the bye should be more involved
            <br>

            <h3 class="impact">WR AJ Brown</h3> -- Big 2nd half
            <br>

            <h3 class="impact">TE Kyle Pitts</h3> -- Pitts finally went off
            <br>

            <h3>WR Emanuel Sanders</h3> -- It's a little late is his career.
            <p>
                Sven is below me on the standings.  I can't think of a pejoritive worse than the disaster.  The ruin?  The void?  The pit?  Team BRs on the Pit?  no?  okay.

                Austin Ekeler is the RB3 on the year so I was officially super wrong about him but I'm still never drafting him.
            </p>
            <p>
                I like how Pittman came on for you.  Kittle back.
            </p>
            <p>
                I think Lockett and Higgins killed you because the guys you should get are Metcalf and Chase.  Swap those players out and you have a good team.
            </p>
            <p>
                But you don't have a good team.  Rough Gibson year. That was a risky pick.

            <h3 class="impact">QB Aaron Rodgers</h3> - MVP, still has Adams
            <br>
            <h3 class="impact">RB Antonio Gibson</h3> - 7 points!?  Raise the alarm
            <br>
            <h3 class="question">RB Austin Eckeler</h3> - Was on BYE!  What a loser
            <br>
            <h3 class="impact">WR Tee Higgins</h3> -- Made Big plays but only got 13 fantasy points.
            <h3 class="question">WR Tyler Lockett</h3> -- I could have told you this wasn't going to work without Wilson.
            <br>
            <h3 class="question">TE George Kittle</h3> -- I think he's hurt with 0 points.
            <p>
                Nice job with Zach Ertz, of course when I pay 25 dollars for him he gets me one point but then he immediately skyrockets in value when I drop him.
            </p>
            <p>
                Lockett's gonna be really really bad, and Tee Higgins just isn't cutting it this year.  I don't know how I pulled off the semis with Higgins and Aiyuk last year.  They are awful this year.
            </p>
            <p>
                With Rodgers, Ekeler and Gibson you have a nice start to a great team but your wide recievers are wack.    Your depth is uninspiring, and you should be dealing a Zach Moss or a Singletary to an RB-needy team in exchange for upside wide recievers like Kadarius Toney.  And why is he on my team?  He should be on your team.  You need to drop average bench players and hold onto lottery tickets if you ever want to have a great team.
            </p>
            <p>
                I'm sorry.. I don't hate you.  I just hate your team.
            </p>
            <p>
                I could honestly rank my team at dead last but I think my team has better long-term prospects then these teams below me if my team gets healthy.

                My team sucks and all I get are one bad news report after another.  I remember when I won everything that happened benefitted me in someway.  This year I read the injury report and none of my players are healthy and then I'll get suprise inactives from Kamara and Antonio brown and shit.

            <br>
            <h3 class="question">WR Devonta Smith</h3> -- Jaylen Hurts made only 1 NFL throw last game and it was a Dig route to Devonta.  Do it more Jaylen.  All you do is run on every single damn play.
            <br>
            <h3 class="question">TE Rob Gronkowski</h3> -- I don't know man, will he play?
            <br>
            <h3>WR Kadarius Toney</h3> -- I don't know what to expect from this guy but he certainly is giving me OBJ rookie year vibes and moves like no one I've even seen with this weird jab step dead leg that defenders fall for every time.
            <p>
                The reason the Eagles don't run is that every time they call a pass play it turns into Jaylen Hurts running for 1 yard out of bounds, barely getting the corner or throwing it at the last second to a double covered receiver.  He's HORRIBLE.  Super frustrating landing spot for such a stud young WR.
