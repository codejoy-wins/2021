            <p><span id="purplefirst">L</span>amar Jackson finally beat the chiefs.</p>
            <p>
                During the pregame show they went around and every single analyst picked the chiefs.
            </p>
            <p>
                That's why we watch, as my dad always says.  We don't know what will happen.
            </p>
            <p>
                Even with fourth string running backs and practice squad players, the combination of Lamar Jackson in the backfield is just too much for defenses to defend.  The Ravens ended up getting massive running lanes at will.
            </p>
            <p>
                You look at the other side of the ball and even with the threat of Patrick Mahomes arm, the running game can't get going.  Maybe that's because the Ravens are so good up front on both sides of the ball, but I really think it's the Talent of Lamar Jackson and the willingness to run.  Lamar won't do this every game.  He wouldn't last the season healthy.  But against the chiefs, to get the monkey off his back, he was unstoppable.
            </p>
            <p>
                Of Course, Mahomes still had victory ready to go until Clyde Edwards Nowhere coughed it up, but credit to Lamar Jackson.
            </p>
            <p>
                If He's trying his hardest to run and use his full range of athleticism I don't think there's a more dangerous QB than Lamar.  However, I also think it's not sustainable.  And the perfect quarterback is like Russell Wilson who's both elusive and devestating with his arm.  That's what makes Mahomes so good -- He has sneaky athleticism but saves it for big moments.  That's also why I like Kyler, but nobody is a better runner than Lamar at QB in the history of football and that's the hardest thing to defend hands down. It's just double edged because if he gets hurt they're screwed.
            </p>
            <p>You know the drill, players I love and hate compared to other analysts are highlighted and described.  Let's go.</p>

            <p><span id="orangefirst">E</span>nie's team has Nick Chubb.  Nick Chubb isn't about flash.  He's about production.</p>
            <p>
                Speaking of production, this team is averaging over 165 points per game to start the season.
            </p>
            <p>
                He also has Kelce and Russ who are both all world.
            </p>
            <p>
                Ernie's team is balling out.  Henderson is banged up but that rams RB job is super valuable and I'm hoping Sony takes it and runs with it.

            <h3>WR Debo Samuel</h3>
            <p>
                This team is playing out of it's mind and I regret not taking Chubb at 3 because he is outscoring Kamara but I'm hoping Alvin can have a signature day soon.
            </p>
            <p>
                Cooper Kupp continues to suprise me, and looks to be ready for a great year.  Russell Wilson is just magical.

            <h3>The Developer - Max Jann</h3>
            <p><span id="first">M</span>y team takes a nose dive this week. Rounding to the nearest point, I only put up 91 points.  Last week I had 169.  So I'm averaging 130.  Not bad if I can stay afloat until Beckahm and Thomas save my WR core.  CEH is truly a disaster.  Having Dobbins go down and CEH flop and Winston revert to his interception ways and tank Kamara is really hurting right now.  But I have a great QB, Gronk is legit, and Antonio Brown will rebound I think.</p>
            <p>
                My team is ranked last before the season because computers cannot quantify it.  Is AB washed?  Is Gronk Washed?  Is Tom Brady too old to get them the ball?  Are Devonta Smith and Jaylen Waddle really ready to contribute right away?  Is Kyler's slump from last year injury related, and he'll be good again to start the year? Will Jameis winston be able to support the Saints offense enough for Alvin Kamara to still find the endzone? All of these questions were answered with a resounding yes.  
            </p>
            <p>
                My rookie Recievers struglled but they're both basically number one targets on their team so if the Eagles and Dolphins manage to score it should go throught Smith and Waddle.
            </p>
            <p>
                Even when I had my RB1 and RB2, I took an early 3rd to absorb an injury.  And even when I had my WR1 WR2 and WR3 I immediately took a deadly 4 and 5 of Smith and Waddle.
            </p>
            <p>
                Let's see what Fields can do with the starting job.  I think the Bears are gonna be great.

                The reason I don't rank this team higher is simply Ezekiel Elliot and Dak Prescott.  I'm just not a huge believer in either.   I think the cowboys are overrated.  Not bad, but overrated.  Lamb and Pollard look like their best players so far this year.

                Andrew is averaging 148 fantasy points per game, but I don't think Marvin Jones and Brandin Cooks are sustainable whatsoever.  I think it's a lucky start.

                This team is getting very lucky with Cooks and Jones but maybe Seif just knows Cooks is a good player and value.  I doubt it.  I think Jones and Cooks will both put up goose eggs, especially with Tyrod out.
            </p>
            <p>
                Still, really good foundation to this team with the QB, above average TE, and nice RBs to go with CeeDee Lamb.  Just needs some legit WR depth.

                The thing I don't like about Justin's team is Ryan Tannehil.  I think Tannehil will be good with Julio, but the whole point of taking Tannehil is taking him late, and he took him early, erasing the value he could have got at the quarterback position, without elite rushing or passing upside.  Sure enough, he sucked week 1.

                Montgomery looked great.  Only reason I took CEH over him is I can't bear the sight of Andy Dalton at QB.  If they hand the keys completely to fields, I might offer him a trade straight up CEH For Montgomery... and he'll probably decline.  As explosive as KC is, they don't need Edwards-Helaire.  The Bears live off of Montgomery right now.

                I really think this team should have gone Trey Lance or Justin Fields or someone exciting at QB to replace Tannehil.

                I moved Justin's team up because of the acquisition of Mike Evans.

                This team will rebound when Aiyuk gets up to full speed and when the Titans aren't getting their faces blown off by Kyler Murray.

            <p>
                I like my RB1's and 2's to be the best players on their team or irreplacable.  Eckeler's entire opportunity came from Melvin Gordon holding out and the team showing Gordon what they can do with his backup.   It's the James Connor effect.  When Leveon wanted more money, they had Connor have a great year.  Why didn't you draft him in the first round?  He's the same skill level as Eckeler

            <p>
                This team was relying heavily on Raheem Mostert to pan out as an RB2, and he's lost for the year.  Charlie took a QB and TE early.  Hockenson looks like the main target in Detroit as planned, so that's fine, but I feel like Josh Allen played out of his mind last year, and I'm not sure if he can replicate it and deliver on that draft value.  I had Kyler, Brady, Mahomes, and Russell Wilson all above him in my rankings.
            </p>
            <p>
                Ridley, although not Hopkins, is a good piece to build around, and I believe in Jonathan Taylor if the colts can get their shit together.  Carson Wentz has been awful since the Eagles won a superbowl without him.
            </p>
            <p>
                Replacing Mostert is hard but I think you can slide in Drake.  Drake to me is like Kareem Hunt.  The Browns formula of having a 1-2 punch seems to be what the Raiders are trying to do with Jacobs and Drake.
            </p>
            <p>
                Julio Jones might need to be traded.  He's kind of a wild card at this point and you could consider cashing in on name value with a team that can afford to be patient with his production.  
            </p>
            <p>
                I don't think TY Hilton is worth rostering, and I don't like the 2nd tight end in the draft because you needed to add some WR Depth that scares people.
            </p>
            <p>
                You need a dynamic WR from waivers like a Christian Kirk, Gabriel Davis, or Marquez Calloway.
