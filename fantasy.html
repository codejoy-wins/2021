            <p><span id="greenfirst">D</span>avante Adampants.</p>
            <p>
                Why do we call him that?
            </p>
            <p>
                There's this guy with some audiotapes on youtube with some of my favorite videos.  He goes by the name Jonathan Adampants.  I always recommend him so last year when it was my turn to draft Sven suggested I take Adams and name my team Davonte Adampants.  I went with Chubb instead.  It's a missed opportunity that will always haunt me.
            </p>
            <p>
                Drafting Adams is tricky because you end up without a stud running back in most situations.  However, it takes a truly special player to be dubbed the number one guy, have defenses circle you throughout the week, and still deliver value.  It's remarkable to me that Adams continues to beat the double team.  Some of it is definitely Rodgers, but when Rodgers misses games Adams continues to dominate.
            </p>
            <p>He's a red zone threat, he's a possession receiver, and he's a deep threat.  There's nothing he can't do.  He's fast, physical and is also the best route runner in the league.  His gold Air Jordan gloves really suit him, as he has golden hands and the mad hops right now to back it up.</p>

            <h3>Two Girls One Cupp - Ernie McMillan</h3>
            
            <p><span id="orangefirst">J</span>amar Chase is one of those player that you regret not drafting. I miss watching the Bengals game and I think the Bengals have a brighter future than the Steelers at this point.  The Ravens won't go away with Lamar Jackson and it's a tough division with Cleveland, but J'mar Chase just continues to surpass the lofty expectations placed on him and he defies any doubters.  The dude sat out a year of college and still got taken as the first WR and you're seeing why.  Excellent draft pick by Ernie, especially since he didn't go WR heavy, so he has a really strong team around him. </p>
            <p>
                Nick chubb had two touchdowns, one a 50+ yarder, and yet, you have to be slightly disappointed.  Kareem Hunt is the thorn in Nick Chubb's fantasy value and Kareem outscored him yet again with another two touchdowns of his own.
            </p>
            <p>
                Hunt is devestating to have on the same team because Hunt drives are actaully more successful than Chubb drives.  When Hunt's in the backfield, the D/St doesn't know if it's run or pass, so he catches them by surprise. With Chubb, they can stack the box on first down.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Russell Wilson injury is extremely problematic for this team.  It's very hard to rank this team until I see his plans at Quarterback.  Russell Wilson vs Patrick Mahomes is anyone's game.  But if he throws in someone like Daniel Jones he's liable to get killed at that position.
            </p>
            
            <h3 class="question">QB Russell Wilson</h3> -- Out
            <br>
            <h3 class="impact">RB Nick Chubb</h3> -- Home run hitter
            <br>
            <h3 class="impact">Darrel Henderson Jr</h3> -- This offense is so good and the defense makes him run the ball with the lead.  There's no denying the value here.

            <p>
                Can this team stay healthy?  Because Darrel Henderson gets banged up a lot, and Debo Samuel runs like a man possessed and forgets to protect himself.

                Chris also has James Robinson doing well.
            </p>
            <p>
                Losing CEH due to injury and Kareem Hunt to trade really hurts the rb depth of this team.  Tyson isn't getting points anymore and Gainwell is a shot in the dark.  2 Solid RB's are necessary to be a top team in our league, and Chris still has that going for him.  Putting up 150+ points with a quiet single digit game from both Diggs and Waller is impressive.  Unbelievable comeback by Trevor on MNF with Lamar Jackson hands Chris his second loss of the season.
            </p>

            <br>
            <h3 class="impact">WR Mike Williams</h3> -- Wow... I got to see it in person
            <p>
                I don't really know what to say about Mike Williams.  I think it's more a function of Justin Herbert being great and Keenan Allen being overrated in fantasy but he has to throw to someone.  Mike's been a good player in the leauge for a while but this is the first time he's shown consistency.  Caught two long bomb blown coverage touchdowns but it also a favorite target of Herbert on third down.
            </p>
            <p>
                Waller and Diggs' production has been concerning.  They are both must starts but it seems like this just isn't their year for fantasy value considering their draft price.  I haven't seen the Bills play much but it must be frustrating to watch Allen slinging it all over the field and have Diggs not get stats.
            </p>
            <p>
               I'm demoting this team because the structure of it just doesn't have as much upside as others until CEH comes back healthy and productive and Diggs and Waller start pulling their weight.
            </p>
            <p>
                Still, a Tier 1 team.

            <p>
                He's just unstoppable.  There's no flaw to his game.  He runs fast away from the rush and can see over the lineman and can throw with touch or identify a streaking Mike Williams and drop it in the basket, or just rush for a 20 yard touchdown.               
            </p>
            <p>
                He put up damn near 50 points this week in fantasy and reality and made Myles Garrett look like a non-factor.

                This team is flawed.  There's no doubt about it.  The running back situation is not pretty at all.  But, Mike Davis fell into the endzone, and Miles sanders gets low double digit points.  The wide receivers and qb on this team really push it over the top of all of us, at least this week.  No injuries other than to his lousy TE which resulted in an upgrade.  I like this team a lot... but it's upside, although tremendous is limited by the fact that Mike Davis ain't getting you a monster week and neither are any of your backs.

               Le'Veon Bell is done.  Maybe I should realize the same about OBJ.  But Mark Andrews just came through like nothing I've ever seen.  Overcoming Michael Pittman's huge game and just dominating the second half.
            </p>
            <p>
                This team is extremely good because Patrick Mahomes can hurt you, andrews can go off, his running backs are monsters in ppr, and then he's got guys like Marquise brown and ceedee lamb that can compete at WR.
            </p>
            <p>
                He's still a little bit lost at WR, thinking that Marvin Jones is a good play really speaks to the ignorance of Seif, (hahaha) but he's figure out a WR combo eventually.  Marquise brown is an obvious start for this team.

                With Mitchell and Woods having good weeks, Trevors team is definitely in the mix with the good teams.  His lack of a good TE hurts him though.  The Woods/ Higbee combo isn't scaring anyone.

            <p>
                Even with Russell Wilson playing poorly and leaving the game with an injury, Murray only got me like a 5 point advantage.
            </p>
            <p>
                Antonio Brown went off and I picked up Kadarius Toney who had 30 points on my bench.  With Mike Thomas coming back and me thinking about benching OBJ because of the emergence of Devonta Smith and Toney, I think my wide recievers are actually working out.
            </p>
            <p>
               I really want to be at .500 when Michael Thomas comes back, but having Kamara on bye hurts this week.  Luckily I dodged an injury with CEH for Hunt and Hunt is playing out of his mind right now... probably RB5 or better on the season.  We'll see if Sony Michel can step up this week.  It's unlikely, and my thin depth at RB makes me rank myself lower this week.  
            </p>
            <p>
                Gronk got hurt and my Backup plans have failed miserably.  Spending 28 dollars on Zach Ertz and having him score 1 point ending up almost spoiling a wonderful day at Sofi Stadium.  I don't know why I dropped Njoku.  I think it's because he had 0 points and the Browns were using Hooper more, but I've always believed he could be my TE in fantasy... and we'll see who ends up with him this week.

            <h3>WR Kadarius Toney</h3> -- I don't know what to expect from this guy but he certainly is giving me OBJ rookie year vibes and moves like no one I've even seen with this weird jab step dead leg that defenders fall for every time.
            <p>
                I think the Murray and Kamara combo is going to be devestating
            </p>
            <p>
                Two tough losses in a row against teams going off against me with my TE struggling.  But if Gronk comes back or I get Njoku, I think my team has the tools to be amazing.  Like a 200 point week is in the cards, where as some teams are limited by lack of explosiveness from his running backs.  If I could trade my team for any of the teams below me, I wouldn't.
            </p>

            <p>
                You guys can rabble rabble about my team being ranked this high but the fact is I have 2 RB1s statistically in Kamara and Hunt.  My QB is still an elite Start, and I have long term solutions at TE and WR with the best kicker in the league so I really do think my team belongs near the top of the league right now.

                DJ Moore had an off week, but that's to be expected when you're relying on Sam Darnold.

            <p>
                This team has potential but has a glaring hole at quarterback and no path I can see to filling it.  It's very clearly not a Tier 1 team and I put it in Tier 2 as in noticably worse than the other teams in Tier 1.
            </p>
            <p>
                If this teams get's his RB's back healthy and finds a solution at QB, it could be a tier 1 team.

                Tough loss this week.  130+ point losses are always tough.  The only think that jumps out at me is Keenan Allen is a lousy fantasy option and he's overpriced as always and, Dallas Goedert isn't who we want him to be.  Ertz is still there with his 1 point and 7 targets.

                The good news is that Diantae Johnson is healthy (knock on wood) and with Juju down, he should lead the league in target share.  Allen is still a usable assett but maybe trade him if you can.  I couldn't.  That's why I hate him and called the league pathetically Incompetent, hence the other Devin's team name.

                Lockett's gonna be really really bad, and Tee Higgins just isn't cutting it this year.  I don't know how I pulled off the semis with Higgins and Aiyuk last year.  They are awful this year.

            <p>
                With Rodgers, Ekeler and Gibson you have a nice start to a great team but your wide recievers are wack.    Your depth is uninspiring, and you should be dealing a Zach Moss or a Singletary to an RB-needy team in exchange for upside wide recievers like Kadarius Toney.  And why is he on my team?  He should be on your team.  You need to drop average bench players and hold onto lottery tickets if you ever want to have a great team.

                On the bright side, Leonard Fournette is the clear RB1 on the best offense in the league and I think you can "set it and Fournette it". (courtesy of the fantasy footballers)

                You have 2 good players.  You really might want to consider 1 for 2 trades to just get a complete lineup because the guys you're starting week in and week out are terrible.  You can blame injury but the truth is Mostert was never going to work and you took only 2 running backs in the first several rounds.
