            <p>
                Why is he upside down?
            </p>
            <p>
                Because he's flipping into the endzone in celebration for fun probably because the DB's don't challenge him enough.  
            </p>
            <p>
                I remember drafting Tyreek Hill and watching him flip in the endzone in week 1 and knowing I'd made a great pick.  Trevor asked me recently if Tyreek Hill is a top 12 player.  I said, "I think he's a top 1 player".  To me, he's the best.  He's a better number 1 pick than Christian McCaffery.  He's the number 1 wide receiver on the season with 2/4 of his games as duds.
            </p>
            <p>No one explodes like Hill.  He wins you weeks.  And on the weeks where he busts, it's not impossible to win.  But on the weeks he goes off, it's basically impossible to lose.  Just because you put up zero points doesn't mean you'll lose. Because lots of players struggle around the single digits.  It's the 30, 40+ players that make the most impact in a game.  I'd rather have 40, 0 , 40 , 0 than 4 straight 20's.</p>

                He was wide open down the field and Baker inexplicably through a bullet pass out of bounds instead of lobbing it over the top in the fourth quarter.
            </p>
            <p>
                I missed a lot of the game, but I heard mutiple sources say he could of had 180 yards and 2 TDs.
            </p>
            <p>
                I'm tired of it.  Nothing's changed.  Baker sucks with Odell on the field.  He's somehow incapable of getting him the football.
            </p>
            <p>I lost a pretty close game, I'd be better off starting Hunter Renfrow.  I don't want to live in that world.  Get your shit together, Baker.</p>

                I'll be at the game next week.  So when Odell catches a touchdown, know I'll be there cheering him on, and booing Austin Eckeler.

            <p><span id="bluefirst">C</span>EH is rushing for 100 yards a game and catching a receiving touchdown every week since I traded him.  Hunt is dominating too so it's a difficult trade to evaluate.  However, I think CEH's production is more sustainable.  Hunt's the better player, but after the past couple of games I think Chris has to be happy with that trade.</p>

            <p>
                I'm sorry but I don't think there's a single player on this lineup that doesn't scare you.  Also his bench is ridiculous with Tyson Williams, and James Robinson among others
            </p>
            <p>
                Chris's team is undoubtably the team to beat right now, and I don't plan on moving him from the top spot for a while.
            </p>
            <p>
                Chris has been extremely crafter on the wire this season.  Adding RB's to his bench even when he's not RB needy is impressive to me.  Nice add of Gainwell and Tyson.

                Speaking of production, Nick Chubb has better days ahead.
            </p>
            <p>
                Hunt is devestating to have on the same team because Hunt drives are actaully more successful than Chubb drives.  When Hunt's in the backfield, the D/St doesn't know if it's run or pass, so he catches them by surprise. With Chubb, they can stack the box on first down.
            </p>
            <p>
                However, Chubb has Home Run ability, very similar to Derrick Henry.

            <h3 class="impact">WR Debo Samuel</h3> -- Debo is just blowing me away this year with his production
            <br>
            <p>
                I think this team is the only team that really gives Chris a run for his money at the number one spot right now.  
            </p>
            <p>
                Michel had negative fantasy points this week and I was just flat out wrong about this backfield.  Ernie benefits.  I play him this week in the Chubb vs. Hunt matchup.  Hunt's been outproducing him, but I am not counting on that trend continuing.  Although Baker's inability to hit his wide receivers makes Kareem Hunt our defacto #1 receiver which is phenomenal for a running back in a ppr league.

                My kicker and defense dominated.  Devonta Smith finally went off again.  Gronk getting injured really screwed up my week and Freirmuth was not ready for his moment in the limelight.
            </p>
            <p>
                AB dropped 2 touchdowns.  You don't get style points in fantasy, you just get points.  I'll try to remember that next time I try to start someone like Pat Freirmuth.  I should have known Big Ben just throws to one receiver since 2010.  It's been all AB, and Diantae Johnson.
            </p>
            <p>
               Alvin Kamara had a career high in carries, over 25 I think, and only got 13 fantasy points.  He had zero TDs, and ZERO TARGETS.  I specifically drafted him over guys like Tyreek Hill and Derrick Henry because he's supposed to catch the ball.  This new saints offense is atrocious and I just really need them to Trade their future for Deshaun Watson and try to win now.  At least he got 130+ rushing.

                Patrick Mahomes is showing why he was the undisputed #1 QB taken.  I thought Kyler would give him a run for his money but Tyreek Hill is just too good.

                Lamb seems to be uninvolved.  Andrew reached for Lamb and needs him to perform like a Bonafide 1 to be able to compete with the best teams in our league.

I know he's probably happy because he won and Terry showed why he's so scary, but the running backs of this team are both long-term problems.  Even more horrifying than Terry is the fact that the Eagles refuse to use Miles Sanders like a normal running back.  Mike Davis is getting outshined by Cordarelle Patterson and I don't see great replacements on Devin's bench.  Maybe you can start Conner because teams are worried about Kyler bootlegging it on the goalline and he's getting easy runs up the middle, but you're running backs do not look good barring some sort of trade.</p>

                Saquon returned to form and looks fantastic.  Brady was in the rain without Gronk.  He'll have better days obviously.  Hopkins started out the season extremely hot but now Kyler is spreading it around with Hopkins slightly battling injuries.  Thielen has to rely on Kirk Cousins not getting sacked.  But Kirk Cousins is always one drive away from succeeding but then gets sacked.  He's a final drive away from Being Tom Brady.  He always gets sacked in the 4th quarter on 4th down down by a touchdown.  It's just what he does.

                Ryan Tannehil had a terrible week but won it in overtime and padded his stats.
            </p>
            <p>
                Montgomery is great but the injury and the lack of Damien Williams as a cuff makes this team unable to climb the power rankings.  Without Montgomery, he would have lost, and now he doesn't have him.
            </p>
            <p>
                Jefferson is playing great, and DJ Moore's ascension is extremely welcome.  Gesecki came through in the clutch, and Evans is consistent.  I like this team, but how will he respond to the injury to his RB?  He traded Evans and Gaskin isn't working out.

            <p><span id="first">M</span>ichael's team has a lot of players I think are flukes.  But Awesome Ekeler?  That was big time game from him.  I've never really seen it until now, but dammit that was an impressive touchdown run and one handed pullup.  I'm honestly a fan now. I wasn't before, but he earned it.  Kinda like Tom Brady.  You hate him until you love him. </p>
            <p>
                George Kitte was overpriced this year.  Maybe Trey Lance will get him to justify his pricetag, but I wouldn't hold my breath.

            <h3 class="impact">TE George Kittle</h3> -- Looks fantastic
            <p>
                This is an okay team with a legit running back and quarterback group.  Kittle isn't a liability.  This team needs to make moves to acquire a big time wide receiver.  You might be able to trade Ekeler before his little legs give out.  Get back a real RB1 and a WR.
            </p>
            <p>
                I'm just kidding, I like Eckeler now.  In the way that a cat likes a bird on TV.  It's not real, but it's amusing.

                A dubious start with Hines at the flex... Sven's team is in serious trouble.  I feel like gutting this team in a trade because the pieces are so nice individually, but when he puts it all together it doesn't seem to be working.  Aiyuk is killing this team.  I would have taken him in the 5th too.  Apparently he was only Godmode last year because Debo was injured.  Pitts isn't going to get any worse.  AJ Brown will improve health permitting.  Derrick Henry is doing his thing.  Stafford's aight.

                This team had no running back depth and it's already hurting.  Recipe for last place achieved.  Dinner's ready Charlie.  Take it out the oven.  You don't want to burn the house down too.
