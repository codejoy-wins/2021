                Herbert might be better to start the year but I think Burrow has far superior weapons

            <p>
                It's not easy to make a Davante Adams team look well-rounded, and I think he made the right choice doubling down, nay, tripling down on WR to try to get an advantage, but passing on Kareem Hunt for Mike Davis is just not something I can endorse.  Kareem Hunt is a legit RB1 talent who finished at RB10 last year.  He's criminally underrated and why I rank Chris #1 and Devin #2.  I didn't draft Hunt because I wouldn't have been able to start him given my RB RB RB strategy to start the draft.  But landing Hunt as a starter in the 5th is the ultimate pickup.

                This team mirrored the strategy of my own.
            </p>
            <p>
                As you can see, we both went with an early mobile QB and got a rookie to back him up with the same upside
            </p>
            <p>
                We also both punted on one position and then tried to cover it up later with a sleu of picks in a row of the same position.  I did it with WR and he did it with RB.
            </p>
            <p>
                Will one of his RB2's pan out?  Yes, but chances are Jones misses some time and then suddenly he needs two guys and all he has are handcuffs.  I look forward to him dropping those cuffs.  
            </p>
            <p>
                I think Trey Sermon is a great pick and same with Trey Lance.
            </p>
            <p>
                Trevor got so value focused I think he forgot to draft good players.  Yes Gus Edwards has great value, but good luck beating me in the playoffs with him ;)
            </p>
            <p>
                The reason I don't love this team is that although he got 2 first round picks with Jones and Tyreek Hill, he screwed it up by taking Robert Woods over Julio Jones and Ceedee Lamb.  Then he took Amari Cooper over Mike Evans and Chris Godwin.  Godwin and Evans are both way better than Cooper/Woods.  Not even close in my opinion.  Trevor loves his targets though and hates competition so we'll see if he can get by on supbar talent.  You cannot tell me Robert Woods is a better receiver than Mike Evans.

                I'm not sold on Ceedee as a 1 but he's definitely a must start which is all that matters.

                Seif's going to need to find a breakout WR to push this team over the top.

                That's the price you pay for taking Mahomes.

            <p><span id="purplefirst">J</span>ustin's team has Justin Jefferson and Christian Mccaffery.  Having 2 game changing players is really all you need to make the playoffs in fantasy.  Look at Ernie last year with Kyler Murray and Derrick Henry.</p>
            <p>
                The thing I don't like about Justin's team is Ryan Tannehil.  I think Tannehil will be good with Julio, but the whole point of taking Tannehil is taking him late, and he took him early, erasing the value he could have got at the quarterback position, without elite rushing or passing upside.
            </p>
            <p>
                It's not a bad year to have Tannehil. This team is actually pretty good.  Montgomery is solid but pairing him with McCaffery just seems wrong to me.  I would have liked to see someone with more skill there.  I also hate the Gaskin pick when you could have Josh Jacobs or Kareem Hunt.  He kept his composure and got some great value late in the draft with Tony Pollard and Russell Gage, but I'm afraid this team is too little too late.  You sealed your fate with Montgomery, Gaskin, and Edmonds, and a bunch of solid but uninspiring receivers after Jefferson.  Moore's pretty great where you got him, I just feel like Justin's days of leading the league in points are behind him.  But he's certainly the best of the remaining teams.
            </p>
            <h3>QB Ryan Tannehil</h3>
            <h3>RB Christian McCaffery</h3>
            <h3>RB David Montgomery</h3>
            <h3>WR Justin Jefferson</h3>
            <h3>WR DJ Moore</h3>
            <h3>TE Gerald Everett</h3>
            <h3>RB Miles Gaskin</h3>
            <p>
                I really think this team should have gone Trey Lance or Justin Fields or someone exciting at QB to replace Tannehil.  I also wish he had more exciting of an RB2.  I like Montgomery, just not as a early pick.
            </p>
            <h2>The rest of the teams</h2>
            <p>
                None of the remaining teams are bad.  I think Devon's and Michael's teams look sensible.  Tim's team could be good if Michael Carter pans out, otherwise it's in trouble.
            </p>
            <p>
                The McMillan's teams are in the most trouble.  I view Henderson as just a hole on your roster and I hate the analysis that says cam akers is injured so the next man up will do what he did.  That's not how it works.  Dak went down and the cowboys collapsed.  Rams will suffer on offense severely without Akers.  Taking a QB and a TE that high is probably not going to work.  I don't think Josh Allen should go ahead of Kyler but I'm glad he did.
            </p>
            <p>
                Mostert is good but dangerous with the rookie behind him, and I don't like Chark either.
            </p>
            <p>
                Both of these teams took 2 tight ends before 10 rounds with each picking a TE and QB in the first 6 rounds.  I think that's literally a recipe for bottom of the league.  Andrew pulled it off by picking 3 interesting wide recieivers in a row but you guys seems kind of oblivious to the structure of your team.  Or maybe I'm just ranking you guys at the bottom because I know you the least and I am biased.  Only time will tell.
