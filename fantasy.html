                Herbert might be better to start the year but I think Burrow has far superior weapons
            </p>
            <p>
                It's not easy to make a Davante Adams team look well-rounded, and I think he made the right choice doubling down, nay, tripling down on WR to try to get an advantage, but passing on Kareem Hunt for Mike Davis is just not something I can endorse.  Kareem Hunt is a legit RB1 talent who finished at RB10 last year.  He's criminally underrated and why I rank Chris #1 and Devin #2.  I didn't draft Hunt because I wouldn't have been able to start him given my RB RB RB strategy to start the draft.  But landing Hunt as a starter in the 5th is the ultimate pickup.

                My team would look completely different if not for Sven drafting AJ Brown and Pitts

            <p>
                I think Aiyuk, Pitts, Henry, and AJ Brown are all going to dominate.

            <p>
                I'm not sold on Stafford without Akers, and Etienne with Robinson there.

            <h3>QB Lamar Jackson</h3>
            <h3>RB Aaron Jones</h3>
            <h3>RB Trey Sermon</h3>
            <h3>WR Tyreek Hill</h3>
            <h3>WR Amari Cooper</h3>

            <h3>WR Robert Woods</h3>
            <p>
                This team mirrored the strategy of my own.
            </p>
            <p>
                As you can see, we both went with an early mobile QB and got a rookie to back him up with the same upside
            </p>
            <p>
                We also both punted on one position and then tried to cover it up later with a sleu of picks in a row of the same position.  I did it with WR and he did it with RB.
            </p>
            <p>
                Will one of his RB2's pan out?  Yes, but chances are Jones misses some time and then suddenly he needs two guys and all he has are handcuffs.  I look forward to him dropping those cuffs.  
            </p>
            <p>
                I think Trey Sermon is a great pick and same with Trey Lance.
            </p>
            <p>
                Trevor got so value focused I think he forgot to draft good players.  Yes Gus Edwards has great value, but good luck beating me in the playoffs with him ;)
            </p>
            <p>
                The reason I don't love this team is that although he got 2 first round picks with Jones and Tyreek Hill, he screwed it up by taking Robert Woods over Julio Jones and Ceedee Lamb.  Then he took Amari Cooper over Mike Evans and Chris Godwin.  Godwin and Evans are both way better than Cooper/Woods.  Not even close in my opinion.  Trevor loves his targets though and hates competition so we'll see if he can get by on supbar talent.  You cannot tell me Robert Woods is a better receiver than Mike Evans.

            <p>
                Mixon's only good when I don't own him.  Same with Derrick Henry.  Have fun, Andrew.
            </p>
            <p>
                I'm not sold on Ceedee as a 1 but he's definitely a must start which is all that matters.
            </p>
            <p>
                Seif's going to need to find a breakout WR to push this team over the top.  
            </p>
            <p>
                That's the price you pay for taking Mahomes.
