            <p>
                Gentlemen, this will be this season's final power rankings because there are only 2 teams remaining, clashing in a championship of epic proportions.  Not only that, but these are the 2 powerhouses of our league, and this is a proper championship.
            </p>
            <p>
                The chiefs are superbowl favorties and Pat Mahomes keeps putting up nice points in fantasy football.  Ernie had Melvin Gordon and Darrel Henderson combine for 2 points and Ernie put up 160+ anyway.  How?  Because he benched them.  He somehow picked up Ronald Jones and with Fournette injured that's a slam dunk 16 points.  Then he also has the luxury of starting Nick Chubb.
            </p>
            <p>
                There's a lot of fantasy teams out there that lost because Kelce got Covid, but not Ernie.  He's got a TD from Dawson Knox whenever he wants.
            </p>
            <p>
                Andrew, however, has the TE1 on the season in Mark Andrews, putting up Kelce numbers and then some.
            </p>
            <p>
                Andrew won his playoff game on the back of Mark Andrews and on the arm of Pat Mahomes.  Which is crazy when He has 3 top 10 RBs in Mixon, Patterson, and Harris.  Mixon went off and will continue to do so as long as he's healthy and so is Joe Burrow.  The Bengals might actually win the super bowl this year, but I'd put my money on the Bucs, Chiefs, or Packers.
            </p>
            <p>
                Andrew has St Brown going off on the lions and Patterson struggling, so that will be an interesting decision.  I would honestly go St Brown at this point in a PPR flex.  He's not a rookie anymore, it's the end of the season.
            </p>
            <p>
                I honestly don't know who's going to win.  I have $50 on Ernie but Andrew has proven his tactical genius by playing with the fantasy gods and throwing his game against me.  If he hadn't done that, he would have been eliminated by Ernie last week.
            </p>
            <p>
                That's all, guys. Thank you for saying thank you. It's my pleasure.

            <p><span id="orangefirst">I</span>f you look at the player's underperforming on Ernie's team right now it's Russell Wilson and Nick Chubb.  I have faith they'll be able to turn it around and enable Ernie to get those huge weeks.  He doesn't have to worry about Samuel and Kupp and Kelce.</p>
            <p>
                Got a big game from Knox of Kelce's BYE week.
            </p>
            <p>
                One of the best teams I've seen.
            </p>

            <br>

            <br>
            <h3 class="impact">RB Darrel Henderson Jr</h3> -- This offense is so good and the defense makes him run the ball with the lead.  There's no denying the value here.
            <br>
            <h3 class="impact">WR Cooper Kupp</h3> -- Unbelievable start to the season
            <br>

            <br>

            <br>
            <p>
                What can you say?  I put $50 on Ernie vs. the field.  Somehow he doesn't need Nick Chubb?  Every person on his roster is a home run.

            <h3>Seifed by the Bell - Andrew Seif</h3>
            <p><span id="orangefirst">J</span>oe Mixon is finally having the year we've wanted him to have.  He's been mostly healthy and gets a massive workload and is effective with it.  There's nothing he can't do and having Gio Bernard out of the way makes his fantasy points keep on piling up.</p>
            <p>
                Playing Andrew's team is unfair because you're getting killed at RB when he has Najie and Mixon catching dump offs, and then you're probably losing at QB to Mahomes.  At TE he can make you bleed with Mark Andrews and then he's got Patterson who's the entire offense in ATL and he can slot him in at running back if needed.  Meanwhile his receivers are quality players with Cooks and Brown and then he's got Lamb for elite upside.  Definitely one of the best teams in our league right now.
            </p>
            <h3 class="question">QB Patrick Mahomes</h3> -- too many turnovers
            <br>
            <h3 class="impact">RB Najee Harris</h3> --  so many dump offs
            <br>
            <h3 class="impact">RB Joe Mixon</h3> -- Great Ceiling for an RB2
            <br>

            <br>
            <h3 >WR Brandin Cooks</h3> -- Decently productive.
            <br>
            <h3 class="impact">TE Mark Andrews</h3> -- Not your average tight end
            <br>
            <h3 class="questionable">WR Marquise Brown</h3> -- Good player, great value
            <p>
                The more I look at this team the more I think it's potentially league winning.  His weakness of WR is hard to take advantage of when they're not that bad in a ppr league and you're getting beat by all his other players by a large margin.  Points just come easily to Seif's team.  His wide receivers are the only viable options on their team, even if they aren't stars they put up good points often.

            <p><span id="bluefirst">J</span>ustin Herbert is the prototype</p>
            <p>
                RIP Devin's team and all those below who have fallen in battle
            </p>
            <p>
                Devin's team has a weakness at tight end and lost the depth piece of Waddle, because it'd be difficult to bench his top 3 WRs.  He's got Barkley now but the Giants offense is abysmal to the point they just fired Jason Garret so we'll see how that works out.
            </p>
            <p>
                Nevertheless, he has James Conner and Damien Harris and his wideouts are usually really good and Herbert has his games.
            </p>
            <p>
                A great team with a great record, but has noticable weaknesses where the other teams above him do not.
            </p>
            <h3>QB Justin Herbert</h3> -- I bet Dkazz $5 Burrow outscores him on season
            <br>
            <h3 class="impact">RB Saquon Barkley</h3> -- When!?

            <h3 class="impact">WR Davonte Adampants</h3> -- Last Dance...
            <br>
            <h3 class="impact">WR DK Metcalf</h3> --Dkazz Metcalf... I miss having him on my team.
            <br>

            <br>
            <h3 class="impact">WR Terry Mclaurin</h3> -- This guy is so good it's scary.  Get it!!!
            <p>
                I think after Monday night's game Devin's team will look a little better if Seattle gets on track offensively.

            <p>
                Chris's team has guys like Diggs and Godwin that get open and are their excellent qb's favorite targets and can succeed at all three levels.  Now he's got a difficult flex decision with either benching Clyde Edwards-Elaire and Mike Williams.  I say start both.  Bench James Robinson.  Trust me, I love James Robinson and his value in Fantasy, but you cannot bench Clyde or Williams.  They are just on better offenses.
            </p>
            <p>
                Does anyone think he should bench Mike Williams right now with the way Herbert's playing?  Also I think Allen is missing the game with Covid.
            </p>
            <h3 class="impact">QB Dak Prescott</h3>-- Having the whole Cowboy's offense is definitely nice

            <p>
                Still a tier 1 type of team.  Clyde back should help bolster this roster.  Probably a better start then James Robinson at this point. 
            </p>
            <p>

            <p>
                I would like to rank this team higher with the play of Murray but the McCaffery injury should take off some steam on this team however it is humming nicely with Jefferson, Montgomery, and Murray all going off at the right time.  Not to mention Tony Pollard and Mike Evans who are quite nasty.

                Austin Ekeler is the RB3 on the year so I was officially super wrong about him but I'm still never drafting him.
            </p>
            <p>
                I like how Pittman came on for you.  Kittle back.
            </p>
            <p>
                I think Lockett and Higgins killed you because the guys you should get are Metcalf and Chase.  Swap those players out and you have a good team.
            </p>
            <p>
                But you don't have a good team.  Rough Gibson year. That was a risky pick.

            <h3 class="question">WR Tyler Lockett</h3> -- I could have told you this wasn't going to work without Wilson.
            <br>
            <h3 class="question">TE George Kittle</h3> -- I think he's hurt with 0 points.
            <p>
                Nice job with Zach Ertz, of course when I pay 25 dollars for him he gets me one point but then he immediately skyrockets in value when I drop him.
            </p>
            <p>
                Lockett's gonna be really really bad, and Tee Higgins just isn't cutting it this year.  I don't know how I pulled off the semis with Higgins and Aiyuk last year.  They are awful this year.
            </p>
            <p>
                With Rodgers, Ekeler and Gibson you have a nice start to a great team but your wide recievers are wack.    Your depth is uninspiring, and you should be dealing a Zach Moss or a Singletary to an RB-needy team in exchange for upside wide recievers like Kadarius Toney.  And why is he on my team?  He should be on your team.  You need to drop average bench players and hold onto lottery tickets if you ever want to have a great team.
            </p>
            <p>
                I'm sorry.. I don't hate you.  I just hate your team.
            </p>
            <p>
                I could honestly rank my team at dead last but I think my team has better long-term prospects then these teams below me if my team gets healthy.

            <p><span id="bluefirst">S</span>ven's team is in disarray</p>
            <p>
                Henry, the glue, is gone.
            </p>
            <p>
                Sven throws in Hines and gets like 20 points.  I love Hines.  The Colts are a great team man.  Great backs.  JT looks like he'll lead the league in rushing without Henry there.
            </p>
            <p>
                Aiyuk is going to come on strong.  I love this fantasy roster and wish it had more success.
            </p>
            <p>
                I think the problem with this roster is Sven went with Carson fairly early, and although he managed to back him up with other seahawks, Carson always gets hurt and the Seahawks cannot run without him.  It's a problem so bad that Russ wants out of Seattle.  It happens every year.  Their offense is just screwed without Chris Carson, even though he's not THAT good.
            </p>
            <p>
                They just cant get any good RB Depth.
            </p>
            <p>
                So that backfield limited your upside all year.  Also just kind of Bizarre production from AJ BROWN and AIyuk but that's what you get for taking a WR early.  Sometimes it's better to just invest in backs early and then find the flyer WRs that end up outproducing guys like ARob.

            <h3 class="question">RB Chris Carson</h3> -- Always hurt, and Sven didn't pickup Rashad Penny with Collins listed as questionable.
            <br>
            <h3 class="impact">WR Brandon Aiyuk</h3> -- Coming off the bye should be more involved
            <br>

            <h3 class="impact">WR AJ Brown</h3> -- Big 2nd half

            <br>

            <h3>WR Emanuel Sanders</h3> -- It's a little late is his career.
            <p>
                Sven is below me on the standings.  I can't think of a pejoritive worse than the disaster.  The ruin?  The void?  The pit?  Team BRs on the Pit?  no?  okay.
