                Devon's team is projected for the most points in week 1 by espn, so I took notice.
            </p>
            <p>
                Maybe Hurts will work in fantasy because of the rushing, but I think Goedert might not considered Ertz is still there but we'll see.
            </p>
            <p>
                I actually really like Swift, and Keenan Allen isn't terrible with an exciting quarterback.  I just feel like the bombs will go to Guyton.  But Devon's team is structured to be unfair.  He's really taking advantage of the scoring system with a rushing QB and ppr guys in Allen and Johnson.  I think Jacobs rounds out his rb depth and starting lineup nicely.  Definitely a good team.

            </p>
            <p>
                I think Aiyuk, Pitts, Henry, and AJ Brown are all going to dominate.

            <p>
                Super good team with some terrible picks mixed in.  Will Sven be able to sort it out?  I don't know.  He actually did a great job last year managing his team throughout the year so we'll see.

                I'm not sold on Ceedee as a 1 but he's definitely a must start which is all that matters.

            <p><span id="purplefirst">J</span>ustin's team has Justin Jefferson and Christian Mccaffery.  Having 2 game changing players is really all you need to make the playoffs in fantasy.  Look at Ernie last year with Kyler Murray and Derrick Henry.</p>
            <p>
                The thing I don't like about Justin's team is Ryan Tannehil.  I think Tannehil will be good with Julio, but the whole point of taking Tannehil is taking him late, and he took him early, erasing the value he could have got at the quarterback position, without elite rushing or passing upside.
            </p>
            <p>
                It's not a bad year to have Tannehil. This team is actually pretty good.  Montgomery is solid but pairing him with McCaffery just seems wrong to me.  I would have liked to see someone with more skill there.  I also hate the Gaskin pick when you could have Josh Jacobs or Kareem Hunt.  He kept his composure and got some great value late in the draft with Tony Pollard and Russell Gage, but I'm afraid this team is too little too late.  You sealed your fate with Montgomery, Gaskin, and Edmonds, and a bunch of solid but uninspiring receivers after Jefferson.  Moore's pretty great where you got him, I just feel like Justin's days of leading the league in points are behind him.  But he's certainly the best of the remaining teams.
            </p>
            <h3>QB Ryan Tannehil</h3>
            <h3 class="impact">RB Christian McCaffery</h3> -- CMC
            <h3>RB David Montgomery</h3>

            <h3>WR DJ Moore</h3>
            <h3>TE Gerald Everett</h3>
            <h3>RB Miles Gaskin</h3>
            <p>
                I really think this team should have gone Trey Lance or Justin Fields or someone exciting at QB to replace Tannehil.  I also wish he had more exciting of an RB2.  I like Montgomery, just not as a early pick.
