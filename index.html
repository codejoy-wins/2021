            <p><span id="bluefirst">"I</span>t's like passing on Michael Jordan."</p>
            <p>
                Said Dabo Sweeney, head football coach of the Clemson Tigers when asked what he thought about teams potentially passing on Deshaun Watson in the draft.
            </p>
            <p>
                Deshaun is one of those "too good to be true" prospects that gets knocked down draft boards for no reason.  There's really no flaw to his game.  In my opinion, he is the perfect modern quarterback.  He led the league in passing last year after losing DeAndre Hopkins and having the worst roster in the league.
            </p>
            <p>
                Patrick Mahomes is defintely special, but Deshaun Watson makes everyone look good.  How does Patrick Mahomes make guys that aren't Tyreek and Kelce look?   Meanwhile Deshuan Watson will extend the play and make Akins look like a good tight end and Will Fuller look like Randy Moss.  He is next level.
            </p>
            <p>It's extremely rare to have a quarterback who can both run as well as watson but also throw as well as him.  The only other qb that comes to mind is Russell Wilson.  Maybe Kyler, this year.  But I think Watson reigns supreme.  I think he's the number one most talented QB in the leauge.</p>
            <p>
                I was just looking at Ernie's team to do this power rankings and noticed Deshaun on his squad.  I read the news, potential dolphins trade this week.  The fact that I just traded Jaylen Waddle for Njokes on me is painful already, but having lost Watson too?  Icing on the cake of pain.  I drafted Watson in the 10th round.  I googled him every day for like a month.  I was following the story but I couldn't keep the faith.  
            </p>
            <p>
                The worst drop I ever had was Julius Thomas at TE right before kickoff of week 1.  I could see it, but the experts couldn't, and I let their projections influence me.  Then Peyton Manning comes out as a Bronco and throws 3 touchdowns to him and came out and said, "If you can't get the ball to Julius Thomas as a quarterback then something is wrong with you."  Manning set the passing TD record that season, and Julius had maybe 20 of them.  Undrafted TE in fantasy.  He was on my team, and I dropped him and struggled at tight end all year.
            </p>
            <p>
                Fantasy is a maddening experience.  Winning is so fun.  I hope everyone in this league wins at least one time to know what it feels like.  Losing is the rule.  Winning is the exception.  This does not seem to be my year, but neverless, I hope it is the year of Deshaun Watson.  Personally, I'm a conspiracy theorist and don't believe jack shit that's reported.  I think Deshaun is innocent.  I don't think he's a bad person.  He always struck me as a good person and a Christian.  He donated his paycheck to the cafeteria workers and was always extremely nice.  I don't know him personally of course.  Just my take on it.
            </p>

            <h3>Two Girls One Cupp - Ernie McMillan</h3>
            
            <p><span id="orangefirst">J</span>amar Chase is one of those player that you regret not drafting. I miss watching the Bengals game and I think the Bengals have a brighter future than the Steelers at this point.  The Ravens won't go away with Lamar Jackson and it's a tough division with Cleveland, but J'mar Chase just continues to surpass the lofty expectations placed on him and he defies any doubters.  The dude sat out a year of college and still got taken as the first WR and you're seeing why.  Excellent draft pick by Ernie, especially since he didn't go WR heavy, so he has a really strong team around him. </p>
            <p>
                Nick Chubb is injured.  Kareem Hunt is on IR and out 4-6 weeks as he was carted off the field.  Somehow, Ernies team just keeps getting better despite any setbacks like his QB1 and RB1.  I mean he threw in Darrell Williams who had a better game then Clyde ever did.
            </p>
            <p>
                If the Watson thing happens, the rich got richer.
            </p>
            
            <h3 class="question">QB Deshaun Watson</h3> -- ?
            <br>
            <h3 class="impact">RB Darrell Williams</h3> -- nice cuff
            <br>
            <h3 class="impact">Darrel Henderson Jr</h3> -- This offense is so good and the defense makes him run the ball with the lead.  There's no denying the value here.
            <br>
            <h3 class="impact">WR Cooper Kupp</h3> -- Unbelievable start to the season
            <br>
            <h3 class="impact">WR Jamar Chase</h3> -- Looks so good I wish I drafted him
            <br>
            <h3 class="impact">TE Travis Kelce</h3> - He's automatic
            <br>
            <h3 class="impact">WR Debo Samuel</h3> -- Tough game for Debo with Trey Lance is still 16 points which really speaks to his incredible year so far.
            <br>
            <p>
                Can this team stay healthy?  Because Darrel Henderson gets banged up a lot, and Debo Samuel runs like a man possessed and forgets to protect himself.
            </p>
            <p>
                As it is though, this roster is almost impossible to stop.

            <h3>Sandusky's Soldiers - Chris Kazmer</h3>
            <p><span id="bluefirst">E</span>zekiel Elliot had 20+ fantasy points for 3 weeks in a row.</p>
            <p>
                How did Chris lose this week to Tim?  What went wrong?
            </p>
            <p>
                Godwin and Mike Williams combined for 14 points.  They are both high quality starts at WR and Diggs got going this week and Chris still put up 123.  His bench is not looking so strong but he did dodge the Hunt injury via trade and has some nice RB depth with Clyde as his 3 right now on his IR spot.  Golladay is probably not going to be they guy you wanted this year as Toney will emerge again when healthy.    I think this team could use some high-upside players and may want to make a trade or a waiver claim on a wild card like Rashad Bateman.
            </p>
            <h3>QB Dak Prescott</h3>-- Having the whole Cowboy's offense is definitely nice
            <br>
            <h3 class="impact">RB Ezekiel Elliot</h3>
            <br>

            <h3 class="impact">WR Chris Godwin</h3>
            <br>
            <h3 class="impact">TE Darren Waller</h3> -- I had a dream Darren Waller put up unreal numbers.  I think it might come true.
            <br>
            <h3 class="impact">WR Mike Williams</h3> -- Wow... I got to see it in person
            <p>
                The reason I still rank this team so high is because Diggs got it going and his RB's are solid and so are his QB and TE.  Although, Waller is kind of disappointing... But you'll take that 10 points at that position.  Trust me, it sucks getting 1 with Ertz and Njoku.
            </p>

            <p><span id="orangefirst">S</span>eifed by the Mark Andrews</p>
            <p>
               Seif's team put up damn near 200 points if he had played Marvin Williams instead of Marquise Brown, but I can't blame him for that as Brown has been exploding.
            </p>
            <p>
                You cannot argue with his QB and his running backs make him elite as I've harped on before.  Big play from Mixon and Mixon still has room to really grow and so does Najee if Big Ben can move the offense. 
            </p>
            <p>
                CeeDee Lamb getting 36 is a really good sign.  You have to be patient with a player like him who had a few down weeks in a row.  Because he got you $50 bucks.
            </p>
            <p>
                Mark Andrews 40 point outburst makes him a lock for the rest of the season and if he can continue to get production from cooks and his WR3 he really does have a complete powerhouse of a team.  I see the new Tier One teams as Ernie, Chris, and Andrew in a league of their own.

            <p><span id="bluefirst">J</span>ustin Herbert is playing at an MVP level.  I saw it in person and I saw it coming a mile away.</p>
            <p>
                Devin's team had an awful week with zero skill players going over 13 points.          
            </p>
            <p>
                Such is life when you go zero RB.  He needs his QB and WR's to explode to win, and that won't always happen.  Teams that can rely on explosiveness from each position will have a probability advantage when facing this team.  
            </p>
            <h3>QB Justin Herbert</h3> -- I bet Dkazz $5 Burrow outscores him on season (I should probably just venmo him that now.)
            <br>
            <h3>RB Miles Sanders</h3>
            <br>
            <h3 class="impact">RB Damien Harris</h3> -- I think Harris is an every week play considering how lousy Davis and Sanders are right now.  At least Harris has flashed.
            <br>
            <h3 class="impact">WR Davonte Adampants</h3> -- Last Dance...
            <br>
            <h3 class="impact">WR DK Metcalf</h3> --Dkazz Metcalf... I miss having him on my team.
            <br>
            <h3 class="question">TE Evan Engram</h3> -- Smart pickup and play
            <br>
            <h3 class="impact">WR Terry Mclaurin</h3> -- Scary Terry doesn't like his own nickname.  WR1 Problems.
            <p>
                This team is flawed.  There's no doubt about it.  The running back situation is not pretty at all.  But, Mike Davis fell into the endzone, and Miles sanders gets low double digit points.  The wide receivers and qb on this team really push it over the top of all of us, at least this week.  No injuries other than to his lousy TE which resulted in an upgrade.  I like this team a lot... but it's upside, although tremendous is limited by the fact that Mike Davis ain't getting you a monster week and neither are any of your backs.

                Devon's team is hard to beat, man.  His Wide recievers have a solid floor and so do his RB's.  Hurts is annoying and almost tied Kyler.  He got a good game from Ricky Seals-Jones and even Sutton came through.

               It took a monster performance from my defense and negative points from his to make this one a competition, but Devon's bench looks really good right now with everyone in double digits besides Mattison who is obviously worth rostering as the Cook owner.

I let Cordarelle Patterson and Chuba Hubbard slip through my fingers, not to mention Deshaun Watson and Njoku.  Then as soon as I trade Waddle for Njoku, Njoku decides to barely play and be injured, Waddle decides to go off and get Deshaun at QB, and then fucking Michael Thomas isn't ready to come back even though he's eligable, and then Toney get's hurt in the first drive of the game.

            <p>
                The reason the Eagles don't run is that every time they call a pass play it turns into Jaylen Hurts running for 1 yard out of bounds, barely getting the corner or throwing it at the last second to a double covered receiver.  He's HORRIBLE.  Super frustrating landing spot for such a stud young WR.

                I was going to move my team way down but Trevor and Devon's team did terrible this week.  A lot of teams struck out this week so I'm only making minor adjustments.
            </p>
            <p>
                I say my team is Tier 3 right now just because it has serious problems at RB.

            <p>
                That 18 points from Hubbard is very key when your guy McCaffery goes down.  That's an example of genius Justin.  Justin is like a fool with a genius mind, or a genius with a fools mind.  I actually relate to that.  It's not easy being clever.  If it was easy, everyone would do it, as Tyrion said in Game of thrones about being drunk.
            </p>
            <p>
                Montgomery being out is really not his fault, and the fact that he plugged in Pollard and got 14 is really impressive, even though Gaskin got 30+ randomly.
            </p>
            <p>
                DJ Moore had an off week, but that's to be expected when you're relying on Sam Darnold.

            <p>
                This team has potential but has a glaring hole at quarterback and no path I can see to filling it.  It's very clearly not a Tier 1 team and I put it in Tier 2 as in noticably worse than the other teams in Tier 1.
            </p>

                If this teams get's his RB's back healthy and finds a solution at QB, it could be a tier 1 team.

            <p>
                When he was a rookie, I knew this would happen if they just gave him the rock and built the team around him.  Because he's such an NFL running back.  He's just a man amongst boys.  And he belongs as the centerpiece of a punch you in the mouth offense that beats you by demoralizing you slowly and then taking your head of like a Mortal Kombat fatality.
            </p>
            <p>
                They showed a graphic during the Monday Night Game and it showed his YPC this season by quarter.  It starts at 2 yards per carry and then doubles each quarter.  By the 4th quarter he's averaging 8 yards a carry and putting away close games.
            </p>
            <p>
                The only way to stop him is to blow them out in the first half.

            <p>
               Sven's team belongs near the bottom but Derrick Henry is pulling this team up the rankings.  I kind of regret passing on him, don't you?  I went Kamara because I've never had Kamara before.  Kamara just had a 30 pointer and a BYE and he's healthy but when you compare anyone to Henry this year they just seem okay.
            </p>
            <p>
                I picked Kamara because he has a higher floor, and also a huge ceiling,  put Henry's stats are off the charts.  3 TD's against Buffolo on 7 YPC?  150+ yards?  The w?  Insane.

            </p>
            <p>
                You have 2 good players.  You really might want to consider 1 for 2 trades to just get a complete lineup because the guys you're starting week in and week out are terrible.  You can blame injury but the truth is Mostert was never going to work and you took only 2 running backs in the first several rounds.

                Lockett's gonna be really really bad, and Tee Higgins just isn't cutting it this year.  I don't know how I pulled off the semis with Higgins and Aiyuk last year.  They are awful this year.

                With Rodgers, Ekeler and Gibson you have a nice start to a great team but your wide recievers are wack.    Your depth is uninspiring, and you should be dealing a Zach Moss or a Singletary to an RB-needy team in exchange for upside wide recievers like Kadarius Toney.  And why is he on my team?  He should be on your team.  You need to drop average bench players and hold onto lottery tickets if you ever want to have a great team.
