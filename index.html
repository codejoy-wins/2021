                The beauty of my philosophy is that if you do not see the problems I see, don't worry.  I view you as an equally valuable part of the body.

                This website is meant to be explored, and many of the pictures are links to various parts of my site.  Feel free to hit the play button above and listen to some of my original music I've made.

            <p class="sane">
                I coded all of this.  It started out as an online portfolio to get a coding job after coding bootcamp, but I've kept it going as a harbor for all of my life's creative output, and a personal challenge to build the best website I can, and to put my philosophy degree to good use.

                If you are a prospective employer, you can view my resume as a pdf on /resume, or fly through the interactive 3D resume game I created to stand out.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you are interested in learning more about my philosophy, I have created a /blog and a /book for you (mostly for me).
            </p>

            <p class="sss">
                My /blog updates itself to the current month, and lets you see what I was thinking about this time last year, and the year before.  It gives it a sort of astrological vibe.  This was a clever design solution, as putting all of my blog posts on one webpage was taking too long to load, so I broke it into months and wrote code that always knows what month it is.
            </p>

                <p>
                    Sometimes I feel like I have to be perfect for people to listen to my philosophy, but I think Nietzsche said it best:
                </p>
            <p>
            “There is a false saying, ‘Whoever cannot save himself - how can he save others?’ But if I have the key to your chains, why should your and my lock be the same?” ― Friedrich Nietzsche
            </p>
                <p>
                    I have bipolar disorder, so some of my lyrics and posts can have manic delusions of grandeur baked in, but I hope you can enjoy the cookies.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Now that you're still here, I will delve further into my personal philosophy.
                </p>
            <p>
                I think truth should be discovered by the individual, but is rather declared by the authority of the State, and then implied and reinforced by the Media.  Search engines are more like self-driving cars than engines at this point and people are losing the ability to form their own conclusions.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you can see that the body of government and the body of Earth or whatever body we're a part of is sick, and the people around you can't seem to see it no matter what evidence you provide, you might be a white blood cell too, even if the red blood cells call you a conspiracy theorist.

                I am not afraid of looking foolish to you in the same way a Grandmaster of chess is not afraid of looking foolish to his opponent while he is sacrificing material for an eventual checkmate.

                With our current government, I'd sooner revolt than vote.  I'm passionate about the Orwellian <span id="cause">causes</span> and effects of both 9/11 and the Covid lockdowns and mandates.  I believe individuals should have the liberty to choose whether or not to wear a facemask, to be locked down, or to take a vaccine.

                My real name is Max Jann.  I have been interviewed before by Google, Amazon, and Meta as a software engineer but never passed a technical interview.  I also interviewed for a game developer position but failed that test as well.  I struggle with rejection and much of my music is about a lost love. I was an insurance agent when I started to build this website.  I used to come home every day after working fulltime, and spend hours coding this website. I wanted a /this or /that for everything.  I wanted to make the ultimate firstnamelastname.com to show the world that I was meant for more than glorified data entry.  I was frustrated with my job that I couldn't get my work done and have some time to work on planning what I was going to code that evening.  I was equally frustrated by the policies and social norms that were implemented during the pandemic.  I would go home and furiously code, pleading that people resist what I saw as tyranny disguised as benevolence.  Eventually, I had a mental breakdown and lost my job after yelling at my boss.

                <p>
                Now I work part-time as a Geek Squad Agent at Best Buy and go to therapy.  I have a much more grounded perspective on my life than when I wrote most of this stuff.
            </p>
            <p>
                I think my music is pretty good, and my blog is pretty cool, and my book is pretty cringe, but hey, I needed it at the time. My games are mostly unfinished and I need to upgrade my computer and really put in some hard work again before I can switch careers.  I think I'd like to one day create a video game where I can do my own original soundtrack and story and sneak some of my philosophy in there.  I'm looking forward to the day when I can have an A.I. assistant help me bring my ideas to life.

                Now that I've introduced myself in reality, I will share more of my fantasy.  Some of this stuff was written at different times.  This site is like a living organism because it's constantly changing and either updated by me or by itself.  You're going to have a different experience every time because I shuffle my songs and images in the beginning and programmed it to comment on the time.

                Words are magical.  That's why you have "curse" words and can write in "cursive" and have good "spelling".  I have given myself the name Elam, or male spelled backwards, to become the epitome of the masculine power they obviously seek to destroy.  Elam means "Eternal; Forever; Tree" and I am growing infinitely and peacefully.

                I think the truth is you have to sustain both yourself and the system, because you are part of the system.  Do not let yourself battle between helping yourself and helping others...
