                It has to be said, my team is so unbelievably bad at this point in the season I can no longer act like I know what you should all be doing with your teams.  But, I hope, that I can still entertain you in a Matthew Berry sort of way, where everything I say ends up being wrong, but it's worth reading anyway because of an undeniable sense of humor, good looks, and overall just a handsome writer.
            </p>
            <p>
                That being said, I didn't watch any football this weekend because I was too busy partying but I did manage to swing a major trade with Seif, and our Commisioner did an excellent job of pushing a 5:30 AM trade through before kickoff at 10AM. Not to mention he slid Javonte Williams into my empty RB2 slot because my phone was dying and I got off a last second text.  Seriously, round of applause to Trevor.  None of it mattered, but life is about games within games.  Life is all about the meta.  The game of all games.  Our league is getting better, and although my team is getting worse, I would rather have a crappy team in a great league than vice-versa.  
            </p>
            <p>
                I've noticed a trend in trades this year.  Correct me if I'm wrong but all trades seem to have one blockbuster player being traded for a player that isn't yet a star.  Evans for Edmonds, Robinson for Ruggs, Barkeley for Waddle.  Most trades are initiated by big names being offered from disappointed owners.
            </p>
            <p>
                I'm excluding my Njoku trade because that was more about me just panicking with no fab trying to pick up a player I had just dropped.  But I'm back in the mix with $50 fab and Javonte Williams at RB2 for Michael Thomas.  Melvin Gordon is the better player and I maybe should have offered Michael Thomas for him first, but it's easier to trade with people you're getting drunk with, and so I highly suggest we all have a midseason trade deadline party each year.  Go to Vegas or something.  Our league is so sick, anything is possible.  The rest of the fantasy world envies us.  They aspire to be in a league as dope as our league.
            </p>
            <p>
                Hats off to Ernie, Charlie, and Trevor for the best podcast in league history, making my long drive super entertaining.  It's nice to put a face and voice to Charlie's team, and to hear Ernie's valuable strategy we can all steal for ourselves.  Going into Sunday, Ernie had 4 possible spots he can put a Receiver.  WR1 WR2 TE and Flex.  He had Cooper Kupp, Jamar Chase, Travis Kelce and Debo Samuel.  That's the Wr1 Wr2 Te1 and Wr3 in all of fantasy football, and he still lost.  Trevor beat him.  And that's just one of the many things that makes our league the best league on the internet.  Westlake Fantasy Football League could aptly be renamed the "Legendary Fantasy Football League".  or League of Legends, but that's taken.  League of Extraordinary Gentleman?  Damn, that's taken too.  We'll stick with what we've got for now.  Let's get into it.  Don't forget to play the song, it's a banger.

            <h3>Two Girls One Cupp - Ernie McMillan</h3>
            
            <p><span id="orangefirst">C</span>ooper Kupp has quite the stat log this season.  Every single game has 10+ targets and 10+ fantasy points.  He has 30+ fantasy points 4 seperate times already.  He is the number 1 fantasy wide receiver which was broken by Chase, before Kupp got the chance to play in the afternoon.  Oh and Debo Samuel?  He used to be the 1 Overall, so basically Ernie's team is beyond comparison.</p>
            <p>
                You can put 125 points against Ernie and still get blown out.  I haven't seen a run this dominant in the history of our league.  Sure, I had a good 10 team league with a great keeper, but this team is just unreal quality for a 12 team league.
            </p>
            <p>
                Not only did he pick up and play Tua but Tua must have got the memo because he put up an overall QB1 Finish to help Ernie's team win another $50.  Incredible.  I'm honestly open to advice from Ernie.  How the hell did you do this?  How are you doing this?
            </p>
            <p>
                After his first loss in what seems like Eternity, it's anyone's game again.  But he still has an overwhelming advantage.
            </p>

                Can this team stay healthy?  Because Darrel Henderson gets banged up a lot, and Debo Samuel runs like a man possessed and forgets to protect himself.

            <p>
               Andrew swung a trade because he had fab to spend, an rb depth piece to sell, and a good record so he can wait for MT to become a thing.
            </p>
            <p>
                Jameis tore his ACL but Michael Thomas is good with virtually any quarterback.  It was a bad trade by me but then again I thought I actually had assets in Smith and Beckham instead of a combined 2 points from those guys.
            </p>
            <p>
                Cordarelle Patterson is a fantasy miracle, I didn't even try to get him because he's so difficult to evaluate.  I still don't believe it.

            <p>
                Seif's team, after the trade and this weekends performance, and a variety of nice assets, is a clear Tier 1 team with Ernie and Chris and Devin and Trevor.

Hurts finally had a bad fantasy day but the Eagles scored 40+ points so if they keep that up he should get you 30 next week.

                Great job with Fournette this week.  The Brady/ Fournette combo is super valuable right now because at least one of them explodes when the Bucs offense is putting up 35 points per game.

                Even in PPR leagues, Henry is a fantasy monster.  Sven will struggle to replace him as will the Titans, even with AD.
            </p>
            <p>
                When he was a rookie, I knew this would happen if they just gave him the rock and built the team around him.  Because he's such an NFL running back.  He's just a man amongst boys.  And he belongs as the centerpiece of a punch you in the mouth offense that beats you by demoralizing you slowly and then taking your head of like a Mortal Kombat fatality.
            </p>
            <p>
                They showed a graphic during the Monday Night Game and it showed his YPC this season by quarter.  It starts at 2 yards per carry and then doubles each quarter.  By the 4th quarter he's averaging 8 yards a carry and putting away close games.
            </p>
            <p>
                The only way to stop him is to blow them out in the first half.

            <h3>WR Leviska Shenault</h3> -- I feel bad for Sven that he has to start a Jaguar.
            <p>
                Sven lost by one this week to a Byepocalypse Chris, because he started Sterling Shepherd who was questionable and ended up not playing,  All Sven had to do was throw in anyone else and he would have won.  These wins matter a lot.  You can put up 130 and still lose.  You have to grab the W when you're opponent has all his players on BYE.  Power rankings factor in the skill of the players but also of the manager.  Sven clearly is not committed to winning a fantsy title, and therefore it will elude him.

                Austin Ekeler is of course responsible, back to his overrated ways, just when you think you can trust him, he goes on BYE and leaves you to pick up the pieces.

                Although I said Swift was great in a bad situation, Gibson's production has to concern you.  Is it injury?  Is it him?  Is it the QB?  Consecutive terrible games from your early second round pick is not good at all.

            <h3 class="question">TE George Kittle</h3> -- I think he's hurt with 0 points.
            <p>
                Nice job with Zach Ertz, of course when I pay 25 dollars for him he gets me one point but then he immediately skyrockets in value when I drop him.
            </p>
            <p>
                Lockett's gonna be really really bad, and Tee Higgins just isn't cutting it this year.  I don't know how I pulled off the semis with Higgins and Aiyuk last year.  They are awful this year.
            </p>
            <p>
                With Rodgers, Ekeler and Gibson you have a nice start to a great team but your wide recievers are wack.    Your depth is uninspiring, and you should be dealing a Zach Moss or a Singletary to an RB-needy team in exchange for upside wide recievers like Kadarius Toney.  And why is he on my team?  He should be on your team.  You need to drop average bench players and hold onto lottery tickets if you ever want to have a great team.

                I'm sorry.. I don't hate you.  I just hate your team.

                I could honestly rank my team at dead last but I think my team has better long-term prospects then these teams below me if my team gets healthy.

            <p>
                The reason the Eagles don't run is that every time they call a pass play it turns into Jaylen Hurts running for 1 yard out of bounds, barely getting the corner or throwing it at the last second to a double covered receiver.  He's HORRIBLE.  Super frustrating landing spot for such a stud young WR.
