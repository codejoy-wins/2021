                <div class="vid">
                    <iframe width="100%" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tmLdT5AKGUo" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

                <p>
                    When I was at Moorpark College fighting my way back into UCSC there were Christians that had a table set up for the students.  They were passing out pamplets and talking about the dangers of premarital sex.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I went up to discuss it with them, as I usually do, and I tried to say how happy I was when I was having premarital sex with my first serious girlfriend in high school, and how it was so spectacular it couldn't have been a mistake.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "How'd that work out for you?" the man said.  And I was taken aback.  It's true, the sex was wonderful at the time, but the pain of losing her in college was enough so that I was seemingly permanently damaged by it.   I had just failed out of UCSC and received this message at a time where it was painfully obvious I didn't know what I was talking about.  Other people hadn't been missing out.  "It is better to have loved and lost than to have never loved at all" is an expression I wrestle with.  There I was, in agony, trying to argue for premarital sex.
                </p>
                <p>
                    That's when I realized I may have been wrong to not ask her to be my wife first.  I went on to have a sleu of other beautiful women where premarital sex seems like a good idea but I really have to say I think the Christians might be right.
                </p>
                <p>
                    All my beautiful past girlfriends, Ali, Jess, Jessica, and Ashley, I miss each and every one of them so bad it hurts more than it felt good at the time.
                </p>
                <img class="picfloat" src="static/img/riddle.jpg" alt="tom riddle">
                <p>
                    Even the one night stands sting now more than they felt great at the time.  I feel like part of my soul as been hocruxed off.  [Harry Potter (Tom Riddle) reference]
                </p>
                <p>
                    I thought I was making the right choices but in retrospect I think the Christian way of life is the smartest way to go about sex, even though you don't get to test-drive the car, so to speak.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This Matrix clip to me takes me back to my first relationship with Ali.  I know everything in this reality expects me and demands me to move on but I wish I had never let her go.  I wish I had done a better job of keeping that first love.  I don't know much about all this conspiracy mumbo jumbo, but the truth is I will always love Ali Kazen and I will do anything for her, but she's going to have to look me in the eye and ask me to stop trying before I do.  Because I believe in the true love we had.  And I'll respect her decision.  If she agrees to meet with me and tells me I'm wrong and she doesn't love me anymore then I will stop, but I'll be ready for that moment and if I get rejected I'll be in a good position to get a different girlfriend.  I'm tired of living the wrong way.  Isn't it possible God knew this would happen and tried to warn me but I didn't listen?
                </p>

                <p>
                    In jail I wrote out a list of all the girls I love and miss so much.
                </p>
                <p>
                    But none of them compare to the love I have for Ali, because I chose her as the woman I wanted to lose my virginity to and I know I chose correctly.  Is it too much to ask to see her one more time?  Maybe it is. Am I going to ask anyway?  Yes, because the only time I feel alive is when I'm living for her.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Shout out to Brenda, Karina (UCSC), Shaida, and all the Amandas.  I love all my past flirts, like Julianne.  And some girls I miss their personalities like Fefe.  I miss you all. I'm here for you all.  I just had to hop off social media because it can't handle me and my forceful emphasis.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "Moving on" is a mistake.  I wish to reclaim all my past soul breaks.  I don't like this game of getting older and "moving on".  I want to reconnect.  I just hungout with my childhood best friend Kyle for 1 hour and it was better than 1000 one night stands with perfect 10s.  I am Voldemort meets Harry Potter, I am Elam Ahpla, the alpha male, telling you the God Blessed Truth.
                </p>
                <p>
                    God bless you all, 
                </p>
                <p>

                    P.S. Shout out to the one night stand from the video game bar, and also the girl I once furiously made out with on the dance floor.  Both of you reached out to me but I couldn't handle it.

                <h2>Yeonmi Park - North Korean Survivor</h2>

                <p>I clicked on this youtube video because I follow Lex Fridman because he talks about Artificial Intelligence a lot.  I had heard about a new woman leader in North Korea and I thought this might be her.  That shows you my level of ignorance.  This girl is actually a survivor who survived by getting sold into sexual slavery to china.  Being a sex slave was a step up from north korea and she I guess was eventually able to escape and now she's on Lex's podcast sharing her story.  It makes me almost tear up and it's really incredible to hear her story.  It makes me want to do something about North Korea.  I make a lot of noise about the lack of freedom in America but we have more freedom here than anywhere else in the world.  I live an incredibly blessed life and want to help people from the atrocities of tyranny.  I only criticize America because I view freedom and liberty as fragile and imperative to monitor.  We must be vigilant and guard freedom.  And we must liberate North Korea.  She makes the point that it's more important than space travel and I agree.  How can we not save all those people?  It's embarrassing.  Jeff Bezos and Bill Gates should be ashamed of themselves with all their agendas.  This poor girl is angry that no brilliant minds have figured out a way how to end her people's suffering.  Our military should be embarassed if we can't figure out a way to invade without letting them set off a nuke.  We should laser beam their leaders from space and storm in there with water and food and rehabilitation programs of the kindest possible nature.</p>

                <p>
                    I spend too much time worrying about my place in the world and how people will think of me or if I'll ever find love again.  But the truth is I'd be much happier if I could rescue these people and show them all the possibility life has.  We should not allow these atrocities in North Korea to continue.
                </p>
                <p>God Bless.</p>

Today I only ran half a mile because I tried it at the highest speed on the treadmill that I've tried and it was too much.  I'd say I've run at least .5 miles for a week straight.  A total of 5 miles in a week.

                    This Youtuber has reached out to me multiple times.  His most recent comment was warning me about Quantum of Conscience but the comment has been mysteriously deleted.  I viewed his latest video and it's blowing my mind.  I knew this technology existed and I already posited that bots were on the internet posing as people in my <a href="https://youtu.be/d2A09iidkTs">whiteBloodCell</a> video, but I didn't know it was out in the open like this on reddit.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm not done listening to it all yet but I'm willing to post it because it disagrees with my recent thoughts on QOC and I think it's cutting edge because it's addressing the views anomalies I recently brought up.

                    Alan Turing was a computer scientist who came up with a test to determine the sophistication of a computer.  The test is simple.  A human being interacts with a computer by text chat.  If the human being cannot tell if it is a bot he is talking to, the test is passed.  Well, ladies and gentlemen, the test has officially been passed with Open AI's GPT-2 or whatever.  Turing said that when this test is passed, artificial intelligence has arrived. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    GPT-2 can generate text posts and comments and pass as human.

                    Today is a special day.  It is the day in between the day that California lifts the mask mandate for stores, and the day California lifts the mask mandate for workers.

                <p>
                    Before I get into that, I want to share this video between Sadhguru and Matthew McConaughey.  I have always enjoyed Sadhguru's philosophy.  He is a happy guru capable of providing groundbreaking perspective shifts.  Matthew is a terrific actor.  His roles in Interstellar and True Detective are spectacular, and his philosophy and commencement speeches as himself are equally as tremendous.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The key point of this talk I want to highlight is when Sadhguru talks about "Selfishness".  He says "Selflessness" is an illusion because we can only perceive from a sense of self.  Even during ego death when I took salvia I was concerned primarily with who I was, my own powerlessness and lack of identity and fear.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    He goes on to explain that selfishness must extend to all things.  Instead of only caring about yourself but not others, he suggests you could extend your circle of selfishness to the whole planet or universe.  Why not want what's best for all things?  
                </p>
                <p>
                    The beauty of this generous selfishness and applying self-interest to all beings is that even when we have that benevolent goal we have a weighted ability to change ourselves more than another individual or system.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In other words, and this is my interpretation and extrapolation of what he said, The surest way to change the world is to change ourselves.  We have more control over ourself than anything else, so the most efficient way to heal the world is to heal yourself.  That's where we have influence.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Imagine a king of a country who's goal is to save endangered species.  He could command conservation efforts in his own kingdom and his commands will be obeyed, or he could venture out into another land and try to save the animals there.  When he goes to the other land, he is no longer King, his commands are ignored, and his impact is limited.  The wise king would use his position as king in his kingdom to leverage his power in his domain to save the most animals.
                </p>
                <img class="picfloat" src="static/img/panda.jpg" alt="panda">
                <p>
                    You are the king of yourself.  What you say ultimately goes when it comes to what you do with your life.  I am the king of myself.  It would be wise for me to concentrate my efforts where I have the most influence.  By focusing on changing myself I can have the largest impact on the world because I am part of the world.

                <h4>Special Priviledges for the Fully Vaccinated </h4>
                <p>
                    Now, unfortunately I have to address this stupid issue.  When the government lifts its petty mandates and restrictions for the "fully vaccinated" that is really just reverse discrimination of the "unvaccinated."  Imagine a Martian king a million years ago on Mars.  He has partial control, as a president.  He is power hungry.  The Martians have liberty, so he comes up with a plan to take it away.  
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Create a Crisis</li>
                    <li>Declare Emergency Powers</li>
                    <li>Have Martian Celebreties paid to encourage the masses to obey</li>
                    <li>Take away civil rights like the right to wear whatever you want on Mars</li>
                    <li>Introduce a solution to the public for a way out on your terms</li>
                    <li>Slowly grant the lost rights back to only those to obey with your plans</li>
                    <li>Segregate out and socially cripple the Martians who do not comply</li>
                    <li>Make it so the rebels have no viable way to thrive within your kindom, and reign</li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    The way it would work on Earth in the biblical prophecy is:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Take away buying power of citizens</li>
                    <li>Give it back only to those who get the mark of the beast</li>
                    <li>Make it impossible to resist your control.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    By setting the standard of an "Honor System" to enforce the laws that say the fully vaxed doesn't have to live by the same rules as the unvaxxed... the implication of this is that someone unvaxxed, who doesn't wear a mask, is dishonorable.  They're making a normal sovern being into a dishonorable lying contagious risk to society.  Individual Sovergnty is their only enemy.  They just disguise it as an attempt to secure public safety, as usual.
                </p>
                <p>
                    People in a free country should be allowed to be free!  Think about this:  Why is a non-vaccinated person not required to wear a red shirt that says "I am not vaccinated.  Please stand 6 feet away for your own safety."  What is preventing that order?  Our Freedom?  That didn't seem to stop what's happening now.  If the non-vaxxed have to wear masks while the vaxxed don't, then by walking around with a mask people are announcing their private medical information.  It's not far off from a government approved dress code shirt with large font saying "Stay Away, I may be asymptomatic".  
                </p>
                <p>
                    Priviledges for the fully vaccinated == Discrimation of the non-vaccinated.
                </p>
                <img class="picfloatsmall" src="static/img/segregated2.jpg" alt="segregated">
                <p>
                    Having a water fountain for white people only, is the same thing as discrimating non-white people.  I fully understand that this is all being done under the pretense of protection against the boogey man (infectious invisible virus).  However, when tyranny comes, it tip-toes, and it doesn't tell you the truth of what it's doing.  The date-rapist at the bar does not come up to you in the name of rape.  He will lie and wait for the right moment to slip something into your drink.  And we, Americans, are getting date-raped by the government.

                <p>I view the Bible as required reading in the class of life.</p>
                <p>
                    It doesn't mean I want to read it, but it means I have to if I want to pass the class.  I at least have to pay attention in class or read the cliff's notes.  Otherwise, my teacher may not be so forgiving when I try to turn a 79 into a B- at the end of the schoolyear.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Any respectable atheist or agnostic intellectual will at least have a cursory understanding of the bible.  So I watched this video.  It talks about the general idea most people have about what Christians believe, vs. what the bible actaully says.  I think this guy does a really good job at humbling himself and acknowledging that the story of the bible is much more complex than the ways people have tried boiling it down.
                </p>
                <img class="picfloatverysmall" src="static/img/branch.jpg" alt="branch">
                <p>
                    He draws on a chalkboard a diagram that shows a person living their life on the way to a verdict of either heaven or hell, which is the popular consensus of what people think Christians believe, and then he dismantles that argument.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Although there are some parts of the bible that mention seperating the wheat from the tares, Jesus says on Earth, "Repent.  The Kingdom of Heaven is at hand".  In other words, Jesus says Heaven is on Earth with him at that moment.  They overlap.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Then this guy uses a ven diagram in a video to illustrate that concept.  What I want to talk about is his analysis of Jesus as a physician.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    We as people may detest child molestors and villians of that sort, however, we try to catch them in the act, or after the fact, and throw them behind bars to physically prevent them from hurting others.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Jesus, however, tries to address the root of the problem.  Lust.  It is the desire to exploit others for one's own pleasure that creates the problem in the first place.  We have a society where we have largely agreed we should let children turn 18 before we can engage in acts that bring ourselves pleasure.  The crime is that some people are not willing to wait for the sake of the mental health of the child.  Some people are lustful to the point where it doesn't matter how it affects the object of their lust.  They just want pleasure for themselves.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Lust itself is the root issue.  If there was no lust in the hearts of men, no underage girls would be in danger of someone violating them at a young age.  The men would simply wait until they were old enough.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    So the incredibly evil systems of child trafficking or sex trafficing of any kind spawns from the seeds of lust in the average man.  Because without the lust inside of us, none of that evil would be possible.  
                </p>
                <img class="picfloat" src="static/img/heath.jpg" alt="joker">
                <p>
                    Even if we put the rapist behind bars, the problem remains strong if he still wants to rape.  If the Joker breaks into Arkham Asylum and lets all the criminals loose on Gotham, all that truly matters is the hearts and minds of those men.  If those men have all found Jesus and rid themselves of their lustful ways then they aren't a menace to society or Gotham City.  If they still feel the same way, then they are a menace.  So I love the idea of Jesus attacking the root of the problem, and seeing how these evil inklings exist in all of us.  Some are just more out of balance than others.
                </p>
                <p>
                    And if someone has themselves been abused as a child, they may be more willing to abuse another child later on because in a twisted sense, why should they get to hold onto their virginity when I didn't get to?  Why should I respect their rights to their bodies when my own rights were trampled?  It's like burning someone else's toy car because yours was burnt and you can't bear the sight of someone else getting to play with a toy car when you lost yours.  I don't know.  I was never abused, but that's just a theory.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So anyway, Jesus recognized that the evil deeds eventually done are spawned from very basic roots of evil.  Jesus brought heaven to earth and kicked out the hell.  That's why he constantly cast demons out of people.  The idea is that Earth has Heaven and Hell overlays, and your hellish reality can be cured by Jesus.  Also, God created Heavens and the Earth, but it was Man that perhaps participated in the creation of Hell.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    Heaven has to be optional.  Otherwise, it isn't heaven.  See, a party that you HAVE to go to is no fun.  A party is only fun if you get to choose to go or not, and it's especially fun if you were specifically invited, or even helped plan it.  Trust me, I know a thing or two about parties.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When I say "Get the hell out of here!" I mean it literally.  I don't mean you should leave.  I mean you should take the hell in your life caused by sin, and get it out of here with the help of Jesus who can cast out the demons in your heart.  It was us, human beings, that killed Jews in Nazi Germany.  It was us, human beings, that abused black people in slavery.  And it was us, human beings, who abused children by the thousands.  It was us who killed Jesus Christ.  One of my favorite quotes by Jonathan Adampants that made me buy into him so much is when he said, quoting Jesus, " "Forgive them for they know not what they do." Why do you think you didin't know what you were doing?"  Adampants in that quote is implying that you yourself now are guilty of the same sin that killed God himself in the flesh.  Staggeringly brilliant delivery of the most important truth.  It is us, that is the problem.  We all possess all the "sparks" necessary for something like child trafficking to become a thing.  It's not a few rogue sickos, it's systemic.  We all have within us the desire to exploit others for our own personal pleasure, and that's just the worst intantiation of that fundamental sin.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I myself watch porn.  If I didn't have lust in my heart, I wouldn't watch it.  If I didn't watch it, it wouldn't get made.  If everyone stopped watching porn, there would be less incentive to make it.  Then girls lives wouldn't be exploited.  Maybe some like porn but there are plenty of girls that would be better off without that industry in my opinion.  Even men would be better off.  My point is, I participate in it.  I fan the flames of lust and help grow it into it's worst instantiations like trafficking. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    My sins are abundant, rampant, disgusting.  But at least I do the required reading, so when I have a failing grade towards the end of the semester, I can go in on my lunch and beg the teacher for some extra credit.  And luckily for us, our teacher is merciful.
                </p>
