            <h3>The Name of the Wind</h3>
            <h4>Patrick Rothfuss</h4>
            <img src="static/img/kvothe.jpg" alt="Kvothe" class="piclarge">
            <p>This is the first book of a trilogy with the third book currently unreleased.</p>
            <p>
                I found this book to be very interesting at parts.  
            </p>
            <p>
                It's a story of a man telling his life story.  I like the parts of the book that take place during present time.
            </p>
            <p>
                When he's telling his story.  I liked the beginning and the end, but I was bored while he was at wizarding school.  The University was surprisingly boring.  
            </p>
            <p>
                However, I think it was in a way deliberately boring.  It was making the magic and the character more grounded.  
            </p>
            <p>Ultimately it picks up the pace at the end and I really liked how it ended.</p>
            <p>
                I think I will buy the second book and read it.
            </p>
            <p>
                Some of the writing is spectacular but I definitely got annoyed by the boring middle of the book so I will give it a 4/5.
            </p>
