                <p>
                    Click <a target="_blank" href="https://openai.com/blog/dall-e/">here</a> for a sneak peak at the technology AI uses for language.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Anything "Generative" from AI fascinates me because it means the machine is becoming creative.  Telling Dall-E to "draw a cat octopus chimera" will immediately generate 100s of images of what you're describing, some of them beyond human imagination and yet we can grasp the concept and built it in the real world if we want to.  "Coffee Table in the shape of a butterfly wing" or "Chair in the sytle of a fossil" Got me some incredible results with furniture designs that are breathtaking.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Also, sometimes they really nail it in a way you didn't think was possible.  For Dragon Flamingo the results were terrible but there was one quality image of what it would look like if a flamingo dragon existed.  Incredible stuff.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you can feed AI enough images of Dragons for it to have an internal concept of dragon, it can now use it's dragon abstract knowledge to be creative in combining it with a flamingo or anything else.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I think Cat Jellyfish was surprisingly convincing.  Looked almost evolutionarily possible somehow.  Also these illustrations are convertable to emojis and that works surprisingly well too.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Anyway, eventually we will be able to code just by telling the computer what to do in the English Language with the spoken word. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Also, if AI can grasp the concept of "Dragon" it can also learn things like "Success" or "Rich" or "Happy" and then generate examples...
                </p>
                <p>
                    For example if you fed it the names and ages and colors and sexes of all the US Presidents, then it could generate a name of the next one that matches.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The generated guess would surpass even my own guess, let's say Michael Heston, White Male 53 years old.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This would be based on limiting information, but give a project like this enough data and you could start factoring in probable presidential candidates and have a real model going.  Like a smart model would only predict based on real names of alive people in current politics.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I uninfamously used deep learning to predict which players are going to "Bust" or not in fantasy football.  The algorithm ended up loving players on high scoring teams with lots of touches on that team.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm waiting for this GPT-3 stuff to be fully available to the public and then I can think of some amazing applications for it.  It's so fun to be able to change words around and watch the images get generated.  Like "Baby Fox in a leather jacket playing guitar" and BAM! 100 pictures hit you with exactly that. <a target="_blank" href="https://openai.com/blog/dall-e/">It's amazing</a>.

                <h2>Luciferianism 101</h2>
                <p class="gold">
                    The following is a post I made in May, I'm reposting Dec 9th:
                </p>
                <p>

I believe a lot of people have never learned about what luciferianism (or satanism) really is. Please correct me if I'm wrong about any of this.
                </p>
                <p>
                
First, the backstory:
</p><p>
The biblical story of the Devil is that Lucifer was God's best angel. Lucifer was the most beautiful, and the most intelligent, etc. He was also the most proud. He thought he could do even better than God himself, his Creator, The Creator. So, He convinced 1/3 of all angels to join his cause in overthrowing God. There was a war in heaven. On God's side was Archangel Michael, who fought against Lucifer and his army in heaven. Lucifer transformed himself into a dragon during the fight and was still defeated by Archangel Michael.

</p>
<img class="picfloatnew" src="static/img/archangel.jpg" alt="michael">

<p>
Lucifer was expelled from heaven and fell down to Earth as a bolt of lightning, along with the rest of his fallen angels. 1/3 of Angels is 33%.  That is the occult significance of the number 33, and probably why the freemasons chose that as their final level.  God said from that moment that Lucifer would be known as Satan, or the Devil.
</p><p>
The Devil and his Fallen Angels now rule over the Earth, because they were kicked out of heaven.  There was also a great pit, and I'm honestly not sure how long the devil stayed down there.  But I'm pretty sure he and the rest of his army have dominion here.
</p><p>
Jesus, later on in the Bible, Lives on Earth and is tempted by the Devil who takes him to a mountain and shows him the 4 corners of the Earth and offers it all to him.  Jesus just quotes scripture to him and does not fall for his tricks, nor does he challenge the devil's claim that he owns the four corners of the Earth, implying that it is true.  
</p><p>

Jesus repeatedly says his kingdom is not of this world, during his time on Earth.
</p>
<img class="picfloatnew" src="static/img/eve.jpg" alt="eve">

<p>

In the story of Adam and Eve and the Garden of Eden, Satan is the snake in the garden that tells eve to eat from the tree of knowledge of good and evil that God forbid.
</p><p>

See, God put mankind into a garden of paradise, with the devil and 2 trees, 1 of eternal life, and 1 of the knowledge of good and evil.  He forbid them to eat from either tree.  The Devil as a snake convinces Eve to eat from the tree of knowledge of good and evil.  She takes a bite of the apple and then convinces Adam to do the same.  He doesn't take much convincing.  Then God finds out because they start acting differently and covering themselves up and hiding, whereas before they didn't even realize they were naked.  God then places a flaming sword (of judgment) in front of the tree of everlasting life, and curses the snake to have to slither around (it had legs) and the man to have to work and worry about the future, and the woman to have painful childbirth and to be dependant on her man.
</p><p>

God basically puts Man in a position where he has free will to choose.  God also gives man commands of what to do and what not to do.  (Also a conscience).  Lucifer argues that Man should not listen to God's restrictions.  Man should be like God.  
</p><p>

I don't know if the Snake from the Garden of Eden precedes Lucifer's war in heaven, but I think that probably makes to most sense.  Like God put the snake in the Garden, then it eventually became lucifer, and then became the Devil Again.  I don't know.  
</p><p>

The point is that some people, luciferians, believe in Lucifer's cause.  They view God as a dictator, and they view Lucifer as a revolutionary.  Lucifer, the light bringer, an angel of light, brought knowledge to Mankind at his own expense.  From this point of view, It was Lucifer who sacrificed himself for our salvation, not Jesus.  It was Lucifer who brought us the knowledge of Good and Evil, and it is God who restricts us and prevents us from becoming like him.  Reminds me of the story of Zeus, who was terrified of Human Beings' power when they had two heads and two bodies, so he split them into male and females so they would spend their time seeking their other halves instead of threatening his reign.  
</p><p>



Okay, so Lucifer gave man the knowledge of Good and Evil, and God cast him out of heaven for it.  But what is the knowledge of Good and Evil, truly?
</p><p>

Well, Nietzche wrote a book called "Beyond Good and Evil" with the most brilliant critique of Christianity of all time.  And I will explain it to you because it's necessary to understand how luciferians think about morality.  
</p>
<img class="picfloatsmall" src="static/img/nietzsche2.jpg" alt="goodevil">

<p>

Nietzsche classifies two types of morality.  Slave Morality, and Master Morality.
</p><p>

Master Morality, he argues, was there first.  When one cave man was bigger and stronger than another cave man, and bumped him over the head and stole his food, that stronger cave man saw himself as Good.   What he says goes.  He made his own value system.  He is good at feeding himself and fighting and the other cavemen is not.  The weak caveman is "bad" at feeding himself and protecting himself and getting what he wants.
</p><p>

Strong == Good,
</p><p>

Weak == Bad
</p><p>

That's how morality started.  It wasn't Good vs. Evil straight away in people's minds.  It was Good vs. Bad, the way someone is good or bad at basketball.  You wouldn't say a weak basketball player was "Evil".  Actually, you'd be more likely to call a good basketball player, like Michael Jordan or Kobe Bryant or Lebron James "Evil".  And that's where the Slave Morality comes in.
</p><p>

Nietzsche believes everything comes down to a will to power.  The strong cavemen has a will to power and he overpowers the weak and takes what he wants.  No problem.  The weaker cavemen, however, they too have a will to power to get what they want, but this will to power is repressed by the stronger men.  Therefore, this repressed will to power comes out in other ways.  For example, in Nietzsche's view, one day the weak caveman, after getting his dinner stolen again and his gf banged by the stronger caveman, the weak man said, "I'm not the bad man.  I'm good.  I'm morally superior.  I wouldn't steal from others and rape others if I was that strong.  You, the strong man, are EVIL, and it is I who is good."  There you have it.  The will to power of the slave eventually emerges and places itself on top of a new moral structure.  
</p><p>

The Strong believe they are good, and the weak are bad, and the weak believe the weak are good, and the strong are evil.
</p><p>

These two conflicting moralities are paramount in the conflict between Luciferianism and Christianity.  
</p><p>

Christianity worships and follows the teachings of Jesus Christ.  Jesus said things like, "The meek will inherent the Earth".  and "Blessed are the poor".  Jesus glorified weakness in a sense.  "Whoever humbles himself will be exalted".  He inverted the morality at the time and gave the weak a way to exercise their suppressed will to power.
</p><p>

Luciferianism, or Satanism, worships and follows the teachings of Lucifer.  Luciferians say things like, "Do as thou wilt".  Lucifer values strength as good, and weakness as bad.  Lucifer doesn't see the strong overpowering the weak as Evil, he sees it as Good, or at least, beyond Good and Evil.  Natural.  
</p><p>

God, on the other hand, gave his only son in an attempt to show people that humility is a virtue before God. 
</p><p>

Nietzsche, though, would argue that humility is not a virtue, but rather a disguised attempt to overpower the strong by inverting the morality.
</p><p>

---
</p><p>

So if God says homosexuality and transgenderism and abortion are wrong, Lucifer would argue that there is no such thing as "wrong".  There is only possibility, and the power to act.  So if you have the power to change genders, then do it!  Nothing is stopping you.  Luciferianism offers freedom from God's rules.  There are no rules in Luciferianism.  There are procedures within the church of Satan or the ranks of freemasonry, but at the highest level -- there are no limits to what you are allowed to do to another person, or animal.  Raping children is just natural to them if they want to do it and have the power to get away with it.  Sacrificing children is also nothing a true Luciferianism would have a problem with.
</p><p>

They hate Jesus.  Jesus ruins all the fun they think they're having.  The Luciferians are trying to expel their guilt and justify want they do that others would call "Evil".  Jesus makes them feel guilty about their evil deeds, so they absolutely hate Jesus and his teachings.  They just want to rule over the weak, guilt free.  They get off on violating innocence, because to them it's only ignorance.

</p><p>

So you see it's not some silly argument.  It's very sophisticated.  It's actually more sophisticated than Christianity.  But the truth doesn't have to be so hard to understand.  You are born with the truth, in the form of your conscience.  Your sense of Right and Wrong, or Good and Evil, is divine.  And you can try to get rid of it with Luciferian Philosophies, but it's still there, deep down.
</p><p>

So if the thought of Jesus rubs you the wrong way, that's why.  We all have wickedness in us, and wickedness hates righteousness.  Darkness abhors the light.  Comprehends it not.
</p><p>

But see the Luciferians argue that God is the Darkness, and Lucifer brings the light of the knowledge of Good and Evil.
</p><p>

So you have to decide what your light is, and what your darkness is.  
</p><p>

The funny thing is, Nietzsche's argument collapses into itself.  Because the luciferians believing they are enlightened, and others are in darkness without their esoteric knowledge... These Luciferians are really in the Darkness --- Absence of God's Light -- and they are using an inverted definition of light and dark to exercise their repressed will to power, in the same way they accuse the slaves of doing.  
</p><p>

God won in heaven.  He is Good.  The Bad, the losers, of the war in heaven, They are now inverting Heaven's morality and calling God Dark and themselves Light.  When the reality is, they are completely dark.
</p><p>
You can't even spell Good without God.  And Evil is live spelled backwards, or living backwards.
</p><p>

Class dismissed.
