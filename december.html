                <h2>Editing!</h2>
                <p>
                    Luckily for me my Dad is a professional writer and I got him to read one of my posts and give me constructive criticism.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm been wondering how I'm going to handle the problem I'm facing with 2021 ending.  This whole project is named under a folder called 2021 and was designed to be a year-long project.  Rather than starting over with 2022, I'm going to just go back over my past posts and edit them to be more digestible for any readers I may get.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I just got 400+ views and 25+ likes and 30+ comments on my latest youtube video I made analyzing the netflix special "Don't Look Up".
                </p>

                <p>
                    I think I nailed the title but a guy commented zzzzz and he made a good point when I asked him for constructive criticism.  He said I should rehearse and write a script.  I'm not a professional, but he's right.  When people watch me they don't want to wait for my stream of consciousness.  Although I think I'm decent at that, it's obviously not as good as if I practiced it and knew where I was going.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'd like to improve on both my videos and my writing in blog posts, and 2022 will be a year where I explore all my past ideas and focus on the presentation of them rather than the content of them.    I got the content out there but I never took the time to edit it and make sure I'm not "burying the lead" like my father said.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I had a great time visiting Austin, TX and I learned a lot about self love from my dad and step-mom.
                </p>
                <p>
                    GOD BLESS!  2022  LET'S GO!

                    I like to name my classes after something and this one is John Wick and the gameplay matches.

                    There are people who are better than me at Call of Duty, but it's kind of like art to me.  I try to make it look cool and win at the same time and have fun. Chess is also art if you aren't just playing to win but also playing aesthetically.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It bums me out that I can't put music to my cod gameplay and call it art because youtube will just block it.

                    The earlier months on this blog are pretty embarrassing looking back but w/e.  I am a growing person and wiser every day.  As for the conspiracy stuff, I'm still on board with all of those.  Look how ridiculous it's getting.

                    Had a little argument with my friend about whether "asympomatic transmission" is real or not.  I say it's not.  I say it's ridiculous.  But have fun thinking healthy people get you sick.  -- Killjoy out

                <img class="picfloat" src="static/img/gpt3.jpg" alt="gpt3">
                <p>
                    Click <a target="_blank" href="https://openai.com/blog/dall-e/">here</a> for a sneak peak at the technology AI uses for language.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Anything "Generative" from AI fascinates me because it means the machine is becoming creative.  Telling Dall-E to "draw a cat octopus chimera" will immediately generate 100s of images of what you're describing, some of them beyond human imagination and yet we can grasp the concept and built it in the real world if we want to.  "Coffee Table in the shape of a butterfly wing" or "Chair in the sytle of a fossil" Got me some incredible results with furniture designs that are breathtaking.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Also, sometimes they really nail it in a way you didn't think was possible.  For Dragon Flamingo the results were terrible but there was one quality image of what it would look like if a flamingo dragon existed.  Incredible stuff.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you can feed AI enough images of Dragons for it to have an internal concept of dragon, it can now use it's dragon abstract knowledge to be creative in combining it with a flamingo or anything else.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I think Cat Jellyfish was surprisingly convincing.  Looked almost evolutionarily possible somehow.  Also these illustrations are convertable to emojis and that works surprisingly well too.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Anyway, eventually we will be able to code just by telling the computer what to do in the English Language with the spoken word. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Also, if AI can grasp the concept of "Dragon" it can also learn things like "Success" or "Rich" or "Happy" and then generate examples... For example if you feed it images of hot girls it can "generate" an image of a hot girl that doesn't exist.  This is great because it's awesome to see lol.  A better example is nice cars.  When you see the nice car that doesn't exist, you can create it! It can give you ideas... It got me thinking about what a person can accomplish using this machine as opposed to the machine replacing the worker.
                    <h4>( The machine + the person ) > ( the machine by itself)</h4>
                    <p>
                        But in chess, when two chess supercomputers are playing each other, can a person "help" during the game?  Like does Magnus Carlsen with Stockfish turned on beat stockfish?  Or does he only hurt the computer?  
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I think it will take a longer time for computers to outproduce humans working with computers.  I think a symbiosis will occur as will as a metamorphosis or rather a fusing of the two species into one.  Artificial Sapiens.  
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The reason this is so exciting that I'm not even going to address the religious implications of what I just said is because I can imagine a cool car or a cool piece of furniture in the style of a shell you would find on the beach.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Like I think Designers and Engineers and Arcitects will use AI Generated ideas and concepts to bring in a new era of arcitecture and automobile design.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I imagine a device in the future where the user can say to the device to project the story he's telling onto the screen.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Then he can say literally anything and it will convert it into a movie / game.  Then, the user can provide feedback to improve the projection in real time.  Commands such as "no, no, the water was calm, not wavy" can completely change the scene and start to form a more and more accurate depiction of anything, really.  The cops could use this to investigate a murder.  A witness could describe something and the device can be the sketch artist and then they can positively ID the guy based on the witnesses real-time correction of the man forming into the projection.  I'm saying projection but I really mean manifestation, kind of like 3D printer Sandman from Spiderman 3.  A chimera of those.  See you could say "Sandman from Spiderman 2" chimera with "Batman" and you'd have a 1000 epic generated ideas.
                    </p>
                    <img class="picfloatsmall" src="static/img/frosttroll.jpg" alt="troll">
                    <p>
                        If you're designing the next Elder Scrolls game you want 4 variations of Trolls.  One Fire, One Ice, one Rock, and One Etheral... You don't even have to design them.  You can just get the AI to Chimera generate a cross between your bass troll model and one of your other models or just an element itself like sand or fire.
                    </p>
                    <img class="picfloatsmall" src="static/img/flamea.jpg" alt="flame atronarch">

                    <p>
                        Or you can hand design each troll or atronarch but at the same time eventually you halt the complexity.  All Flame Atronarchs look the same.   But if you let the AI generate 10 varients of Flame Atronarchs, then you don't have to do that work but yet they actually added to the complexity of the game rather than dulling it by removing the human touch.  You've taken the human touch as far as you can go, but you've automated even further complexity to ai-generated creative variations.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You could even have 10 AI generated levels, and then have your game testers test all 10 and find one Gem to build upon and put the whole team to work on it.  It's just tremendously exciting for humanity what's becoming possible in AI.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        There are so many tasks this type of AI could be useful in.  Such as coming up with a fake name, a fake comment, a fake profile, a fake news story...  The applications are endless.  You could even invent a new musical instrument by teaching it about each instrument and asking it to generate a new one.  You could get AI generated Food that tastes better and is also potentially healthier.  There's nothing AI wouldn't be able to do better if it was more advanced and widely available.  ?  Eh?  I don't know about that last statement.  Could it read a bunch of great comedy screenplays and then generate one it thinks will sell?  No but it might be able to tell you if the screenplay you have in your hand is going to sell.  
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Eventually AI will potentially bring new species into contact with one another.  A rich family in 2057 might pay to have their Dog's life extended and enhanced with a brain chip that allows it to talk.  Suddenly you're in a fight with a dog at a drive through chic-fil-a and you're listening to a story on the radio about house cleaning robot worker rights.
                    </p>
                <p>
                    Final example is if you fed it the names and ages and colors and sexes of all the US Presidents, then it could generate a name of the next one that matches.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The generated guess would surpass even my own guess, let's say Michael Heston, White Male 53 years old.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This would be based on limiting information, but give a project like this enough data and you could start factoring in probable presidential candidates and have a real model going.  Like a smart model would only predict based on real names of alive people in current politics.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I uninfamously used deep learning to predict which players are going to "Bust" or not in fantasy football.  The algorithm ended up loving players on high scoring teams with lots of touches on that team.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm waiting for this GPT-3 stuff to be fully available to the public and then I can think of some amazing applications for it.  It's so fun to be able to change words around and watch the images get generated.  Like "Baby Fox in a leather jacket playing guitar" and BAM! 100 pictures hit you with exactly that. <a target="_blank" href="https://openai.com/blog/dall-e/">It's amazing</a>.
