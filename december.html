                    One of the ones was "I retain my seed" but I hadn't been doing that until now.  Now that I've really internalized the importance of doing that I'm ready to start saying my affirmations to myself.

                        The first girl at the bagel shop was so incredibly cute.  Just perfect.  Adorable.  I could have said nothing, and denied my impulse as a man to try to talk to her.  If I am a man of the truth, and everything in my being screams that she is what I want, then I should talk to her.  So I did.  I said, "Excuse me" and complimented her earing I noticed as I was admiring her.  I'm not going to divert my eyes as if she isn't the most beautiful sight I'll see all day  --pretending not to love her.  Instead I let my eyes go where they wanted.  It's not like the body worship of porn. And it's not like the strict celibacy of some religions.  I think the truth lies somewhere in between.  So anyway, I'm looking at her, like her earing, compliment her and then she turns and looks at me and smiles widely and I get to see even more of her staggering beauty.  This girl was so precious she makes 10's look bad.  She was an 11.  Then she moved forward in line and I admired her cute butt a little bit.  Not oversexually like the porn wants you to think, but just admiring her figure.  Then they called my name "Liam" and I knew it was "Elam" I told the girl at the register it was Male spelled backwards and she must have thought I said "Mail" instead of "Male".  Amusing.  
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        On my way out the store I gave the 11 a card with <a target="_blank" href="love.html">maxjann.com/love</a> on it and said, "I want you to have this gift."  She said, "Thank you" and smiled big again.  I didn't pressure her to give me her number or talk to me instead of her friend.  But I didn't pretend she didn't exist either.  I found a happy balance where I can still be a man and still let her buy her bagel in peace.  I made the first move, and now she has the opportunity to contact me if she wants to.  I still haven't perfected the /love page but most girls see the word love and say a heartfelt thank you before I go.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Then I hiked up to the top of a mountain with my shirt off to get a tan and lose bodyfat.  Because I want to be more attractive to the opposite sex, and I want to be in nature and get closer to God.  I'm still trying to figure out what sin really is.  Is it as simple as what the Bible says?  Maybe.  But is there a way to express my sexuality without it being sexually immoral and yet still feeling good?  Maybe.  I was all alone up there, and could see in 360 degrees the whole town.  I thought about masterbating, but I didn't want to release my seed.  I need the energy.  Semen retention is worth giving a try.  At the coffee shop I saw another woman and made strong eye contact with her and she did too but finally looked away.  It was a sort of natural domination.  We even smiled a little bit.  She knows that if she had kept looking at me I would have kept looking at her until we both got aroused.  I have no shame about my attraction to pretty woman because it's the truth of my existence.  Nothing could be more true than the male's attraction to the female, so why hide it?  Why look away first?  Let the girl look away.  I'm not saying you should stare at girls and oversexualize them as if they're objects but when they enter a room I'm in I'm going to smile and look them in the eye to invite them to be with me, because I want them to.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Anyway so I'm on this mountain top, and I take off my pants just to let my dick breathe.  It feels good with the wind and I start to masterbate in front of the whole town, but so far away and above them that no one can see me without a telescope.  I'm thinking about the male condition, my condition, and what is the right way to channel my sexual energy, truly.  I don't know if a wife is the proper solution to my condition.  What if I had a wife when I met that girl in the bagel shop, would I have avoided the 11?  Isn't that somewhat cowardly?  To let a woman contain you from what you really want to do?  
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        So I'm thinking about the bagel shop girl and how amazing it would be to have her there on that hike with me, and if she could share that moment with me and nature and we could make out and she could suck my dick if she wanted to.  Is that really a sin?  To be a man and to go after the woman you really want who you just met and to wish you could have a sexual experience with her?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Sometimes I think they put sexual restrictions on Christianity just to turn people toward the Devil.  If the Devil has sex on his side, man will choose the devil.  But what if God doesn't actually have such a restrictive attitude with sex, and they just put that part in there to turn men away from Jesus?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I have had no gay thoughts since that unfaithful day 12.18 and I think if I continue to abstain from porn and desperately seeking immediate sexual release, they will completely go away.  I didn't want a man with me on the top of that mountain, I wanted a woman.  Any woman!  To be honest.  Any woman who would assist me with my sexual, spiritual experience I was having.  I could find a sexual use for almost any woman.  Whether it be just standing there and talking about my dick, or if she's like the 11, I would put it inside her with joy.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I'll call her Eleven.  If I had Eleven on that hike with me I would be happy with just getting to know her at her pace.  Just to spend time with her would be amazing.  But I would also want her to know that truth of what I want right now, if she's willing.  If she's willing to watch me masterbate that would be a transcendant experience.  Heaven on Earth for me is having a sexual experience with a truly beautiful woman.  That's my truth.  
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I am concerned with the idea of children and how they should have a mom and a dad, and maybe I should learn to be that dad and be faithful.  I would marry Eleven.  But I would want her to know what I want to do to other girls.  I would need her to know the truth of my being before we got married.  I wouldn't lie to her, and go behind her back, and maybe it's possible she could fully satisfy me sexually.  Just her.  But why not just have her be my favorite and also get to have sexual experiences with other women?  Why not have a threesome with her and her friend?  Is that morally wrong?  Why?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I understand why people choose the Devil over God.  I myself would make the same choice.  If Eleven wanted to come over and have sex with me right now I would do it.  I would cum in her if she asked me to.  I wouldn't wait to get married.  Does that mean I'm going to burn in hell for eternity?  
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I think the Bible helps me learn the truth about myself.  It helped me in my darkest day a few days ago.  I do think that rampant lustful sex is not the proper way to live life.  However, the other extreme of lovey-dovey true love and waiting for marriage to have sex is also perhaps an extreme.  Maybe the truth is somewhere in the middle.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I view sin as like playing darts.  Watching porn isn't even hitting the dart board.  But sex with Eleven is definitely on the dart board.  It's less of a sin than wasting your seed on porn.  
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I swear to God I'm going to figure this out.  I'm going to figure out how to properly channel my sexual energy in the correct way.  
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I may never see 11 again, but at least I'm not living a lie.  I know what I want and I'm putting myself out there.  I'm confused if I'm coming from a place of lust or love because I do feel genuine love for her, like if she was falling over I would catch her.  I want to serve her more than anything.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In the Semen Retention group on Reddit this guy made a post explaining the difference between love and lust.  He said Lust means you want to possess someone and use her for your own pleasure.  That's what porn is full of.  Love is a desire to serve someone else.  I think sex based off of lust is in a sense wrong.  But I feel so much love for that girl.  If she just wanted me to lick her pussy I would want to do that all day.  If she wanted me to give her a ride somewhere I would, or teach her math.  I want to serve her, and of course I want to receive anything she offers to me, and I want to make it clear what I want, so I'm not living a lie.  I don't wanna be taking her to the airport just because I want to sleep with her.  I want her to know I want to sleep with her but that I'm also willing to take her to the airport even if she says it will never happen.  I still love her either way.  It's like the other girl I just was on a date with.  I still want to take her to the movies and show her a good time and be her friend, even without any chance of sex.  Women are beautiful and I want beauty in my life.  I could listen to that girl talk all night.  Her whole life story.  As long as I get to look at her while she says it.  
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I don't think there's anything morally wrong with me acknowledging and pursuing what I view as beautiful.  I think it's actually morally wrong to deny the truth, and to treat women like men.  I believe in treating pretty girls differently.  It doesn't mean I'm rude to ugly girls.  I believe in being nice and respectful to all of God's creations.  But I just love that girl I saw today and I'm so thrilled I had the courage to put myself on her radar, I'm so happy I've given myself a chance to go to heaven right now!  Heaven is going after what you REALLY want and getting it.  Heaven is your dreams becoming reality.  I know because I've been there.  I've gotten my dream girl before.  It is possible and it is worth the effort.

                        Fuck all the gay shit I want to be the best man I can be.  I am Elam.  I will never stop.  I will never quit.  I will rise.  I will overthrow and expose Freemasonry.  I will create Cloudland.  I will have my name remembered.

                        Already in my journey, I've had a few people take notice.  Just last night a man I respect was telling me how much he respects me for being authentic and being so close to God.  
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I hope God forgives me if I am sinning sexually while I geniunely try to find the proper way to channel energy.

                    <p>
                        I think today I had some sexual clarity on that mountain.  And I'm glad I didn't cum.  I'm gonna need a girl to be begging me to cum before I do.  I imagine God will send me an angel in my dreams.  Or the devil could be sending a succubus depending on how you look at it.  I'm going to interpret any future wet dream I have as a gift from God.

                        Sissy porn wants you to put your dick in a cage so it can't get hard.  Real men get hard.  Real men are honest with themselves and pursue what they desire.  If I really am an alpha male, maybe I'm not designed for just one chick.  If I married 11 it would be maybe out of love but it would also be out of weakness, because I feared her leaving me if I did what I really wanted.  No.  Total Victory on planet Earth would be to have 11 be loyal to me, honest with me, but to still be free to meet someone new. And when I say loyal to me, I don't mean my possession.  I would want her to be free to pursue other men.  I want us being together to be a choice, not an obligation, not the only viable option.  True love is both people being able to have anyone they want, and yet choosing to stay together.  Total victory would be choosing which woman I want to spend time with at that particular moment.  Sometimes I might even want no women, and to chat with my friends, or generals.  Maybe I want to be alone and just write or think.  But True Victory, is to have women who understand and accept that I'm the alpha male, and they can have me, but they can't have all of me.

                        Sexual freedom, and just doing whatever I want, is not holy.  There has to be some limitations to what I can do.  But if I do commit to one woman, it would have to be from a place of strength, not weakness.  It would have to be an honest choice, not a compromise.  I would have to truly want only her, otherwise the marriage is based on a lie.

                        Maybe I am shallow, and twisted, and wrong, but I value beauty so much.  I value Eleven so much.  Everything else is bullshit.  I just want her.  I want girls like her.  I want them all.  It's wild.  When you abstain from porn and instagram and cumming you see the truth of the male condition.  The male wants to spread his seed in the best women possible, to as many women as possible.  It was God who made us this way.  Yes he may have given us instructions on how to live in peace with one another, but that he made us this way is undeniable.  Of course you could argue it's evolution and there is no God.  But even if Evolution expained everything, which it doesn't, God created evolution.

                        I still don't have a final moral truth on sexual morality.  I know for me, how to proceed for the time being.  I will retain my seed til I have a damn good reason to bust, and I will continue to abstain from porn and models.  I will continue to pursue beauty and surround myself with it.  I will continue to express myself and learn from my journey.  I'm still only 31.  I will continue to exercise and eat healthy to try to be more attractive.  I will continue to peacefully make the first move on the women I desire.  I will continue to ask God what the truth really is.  I will continue to read the bible.  I will continue to be mindful of the devil, and to meditate on the Lord all day and all night.  I aim to be a great man.  The greatest man who ever lived.  Why not aim at that?  Why sell myself short?  Why settle?  Elam doesn't settle.  He conquers.

                        I've been carrying this Lapis Lazuli around everywhere I go.  I got it from knowledge of self.  I am Elam, Elam was an ancient civilization and I found out Lapis Lazuli is a stone found there.  So I got some to become in closer touch to myself.  I think of it as "Elamite" stone or an Elamite crystal.  Then, when I was watching Black Adam last night, they had a new blue material called Eternium.  Elam means "Eternal".  So the blue Eternium is like the blue Elamite crystal I have.  So from now on, I'll call my blue stone Eternium.  Because it is from Elam, and Elam means eternal.  It's Black Adam's weakness, and I would argue Black Adam is symbolic of Lucifer because he arrives like a bolt of lightnight and his darkness is glorified.  They even throw up the Illuminati triangle while worshipping him.  Satan can't touch my stone.  He can't touch you

                        I was watching this guy on bitchute who's very interesting and great at analyzing the strange symbology in music videos.  I mean just go look at Katy Perry's "Dark Horse"  They're obviously depicting something important.  The great secret of life is that Magic is real.  You are more powerful than you know.  Like Neo, still trapped in the Matrix thinking he's Mr. Anderson.  Wake up.

                        Anyway this guy on bitchute came to the conclusion that he was Jesus.  You could say that he's out of his mind but I think he's onto something.  He's on <a href="bit.html">/bit</a> if you want to check him out. In a way, we're all Jesus.  All the chosen ones who can see the truth.  Jesus exists within us, so his story resonates with us.  He had this interesting theory that the devil was 13 and stole Lilith who was 17 from his older brother Jesus.  Anyway, you might think he's just off his rocker, and even I think that.  But I can relate to it, and there's something about learning who you really are that makes you think you're Jesus.  I know who I am.  I am not Jesus.  I am Elam.  Jesus lives inside of me, and I live inside of him.  He is in me and I am in Him.  Jesus said, to the man who believes in me, he will do greater works than I.  Who is this man he spoke of?  Is it Elam?  Who truly believes in Jesus?  Where are their miracles?  Where are mine?

                        Love can only be given.  It cannot be taken.  That's why lust, and treating women like a possession, is wrong.  That is why rape is so wrong.  It's the ultimate act of possession, which is against God.  We all belong to God and God alone.  God is our Father.  I aim to love, and to be loved.  I do not aim to possess 11.  I am no danger to her, or any other woman,  because what I want cannot be taken by force.  I want to be in love with a girl like that.  Maybe then I'll snap out of my confusion.  Until then, I will pray, and I will continue to be myself.  I will continue to pursue what is meaningful.  I fear God.  I know my self-righteousness is filthy rags before God, and I do accept Jesus as my savior.  I do believe in his name.  I just can't always do what he says.  But he said his commandment is to love one another.  And I believe I do that.  I speak the truth out of love.  Truth and Love are 2 sides of the same coin because the Truth is Jesus and Jesus is God and God is Love.  God Bless, until next time.  -Elam

                    I'm just ready for the rest of my life.  Met a cute girl at the park today and had some fun playing soccer with her and fetch with her dog.  She made my day so much better.  It was so cool to have the courage to appoach her and get to have some fun in the sun, instead of driving away when I was done my phone call.  She was a little weary of me as a stranger but she was smiling while playing soccer.  She had a boyfriend but I gave her my golden card with this website just for that 1% she can contact me and we could become friends. I just want more beauty in my life.  I was told my birthday card is a Seven of Hearts and that means I should not forget to take care of myself by surrounding myself with beauty.  It said I give to the point of martyrdom, and to be careful not to do that.  So true.  I just hope I made her day better too.  I really think I did.  I know the dog loved me.  He kept following me to my car lol.

                    I know that porn is not the answer, and I've been doing a good job of not watching it.  I deleted all my bookmarks and unfollowed all the models on instagram so I'm not tempted.  I haven't watched any porn in a week and my relapse was just one time and then before that I don't know how long I was clean. I also know I should retain my seed and use the energy productively.  But I wanted that girl so bad to use as a sexual release and when she said it's never going to happen I was so sexually frustrated.

                    I'm on a few dating apps, and 99% of the girls I match with I wouldn't want to date.  I don't want to be their boyfriend.  They don't want to hook up with me unless I'm their boyfriend.  I don't want to take my time with them because I know it isn't going anywhere.  Maybe it's because I invested so much time with a girl in the past only to have her leave.  Maybe it's because I'm an addict and have impulsive tendancies.  I struggle with delaying gratification.  Waiting for marriage to have sex is the ultimate display of delayed gratification, and probably feels like the best thing ever.  But it seems dangerous to commit to someone without that sexual compatability established, for me at least.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There are girls on the app that I would be their boyfriend, but they're basically models, not real, or somehow too perfect and overwhelmingly socially valuable to the point where they have a huge instagram following and ego and can get any guy they want so they choose from the very top.  They swipe left on me.  Those are the kinds of girls I like though, and would be willing to date.  But I'm also looking for something more, because I do desire an intellectual connection with a girl that I haven't had before, and I got a nice taste of with my last girl who loved me and still does.  She tried to comfort me today in my distress but she's far away now.

                <p>
                    There's this one girl though on bumble that I really like.  She's the type of girl that I would be willing to wait for, and she's also super interesting and smart.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    My day started out horribly because I texted the bumble girl good morning and she didn't reply.  I asked her to send me a non-classy photo and she didn't reply.  I was also trying to get a naughty photo from the other girl but she hadn't replied either, other than the hottest picture she sent me yet which I immediately busted a nut to. But anyway, back to the bumble girl. She was a bumble match that I only noticed after it expired.  I actually bought bumble for one day just to rematch with her and then we started talking.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I had already asked the weekend girl to be honest with me before I started talking with bumble girl.  But I woke up and felt impending rejection by both of them and felt horrible.

                <p>
                    Then, in thinking I should avoid porn, and also avoid masturbation, I was thinking I should try to hook up with a girl.  I was messaging girls innapropriately and they were not responding very well.  One of them was mad at me and asked me who raised me that way.  I felt bad because my Mom raised me right.  But I had this demon inside of me today.  This lust demon that almost took complete control of me.

                <p>
                    I was so lost, trying to find sexual satisfaction.  I thought if I met up with a girl and she let me masterbate in front of her that would make me happy.  One girl said yes but I'm not very attracted to her and she said it wasn't a first date thing, which completely makes sense and reminded me how stupid I am.  How evil I am.  How disgusting I was being.

                    I know that some guys just want to suck dick.  I know sissy porn is out there and very powerful.  One time, years ago, when I was single and experimenting with not masturbating I ended up accepting the gay guy in my french classes offer to suck my dick.  I did not enjoy the experience and I hated him touching me and I didn't like seeing his dick.  He admitted after that he watched the sissy stuff after I brought it up.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There's something wrong with homosexuality.  There's something wrong with detached sex.  I can't quite put my finger on it, and I'm not judging it because I've done it once, (twice).  Another time before that, I was in San Francisco trying to get with a girl I met while dancing and it was a confusing experience where she was on my lap while another guy pulled my cock out and started sucking it.  That time it actually felt good.  But then I ended up with the girl and the guy in a room and I asked the guy to leave so I could get with the girl but it was his house and so he kicked us out and then I got road dome from the girl but then couldn't park anywhere, couldn't cum, couldn't get hard later and had a terrible time.  Weird night.

                <p>
                    Guys gross me out, sexually.  But dick does not, (like a glory hole) and I've watched sissy porn in the past and been extremely aroused at the idea of sucking a dick.  I've never done it though.  Today, I downloaded grindr for the first time and was seriously considering it.  At least men will understand the immediate need for sex.  I didn't want anything anal, either way, but I was interested in either getting my dick sucked or sucking my first dick.  I'm interested in the truth, and where that takes me, wherever it takes me.  The truth is that if an erect dick was next to me I'd probably jerk it off and suck it.  But see I don't know if that's my true sexuality or if I've been molded by porn, or have some sort of demon in me. I mean sissy hypno is real because hypnosis is actually powerful.  I know that when I was having sex with a perfect 10 girl every day I did not fantacize about sucking a dick!  I was sexually satisfied with her body and my dick working together. I think there's something natural about men liking dick because we have to like our own dick to be able to stay hard idk.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Anyway the point of all this is that I downloaded grindr, put up one picture of my face, put a description saying Im here to suck dick or get my dick sucked.  And then I went to work at my job.  At the cash register, I had to look all these different people in the eye.  Every guy I looked at I was thinking sexual thoughts which I hated and then I was also thinking everyone knew I was on Grindr.  It was a horrible experience.  I felt empty and worthless like no one loved me.  I thought about my whole <a target="_blank" href="book.html">Book of Elam</a> and my rebellion against sissy porn as being a failure, and this whole website being a hypocritical mistake.  I checked my phone and had like 7 different messages from guys.  I had only sent one message out to a good looking guy asking if he'd let me suck his dick.  I didn't hear back from him but the other guys were all hitting me up and sending pics and stuff.  One guy sent me a picture of his naked back and ass and said he was a bottom and loves to suck.  I was so turned off by this and have no intention of ever doing anal with anybody but a hot girl begging me for it.  I put in my profile that I like women more.  Anyway that was a turn off but I was considering taking advantage of that guy and getting a blowjob out of it.  But as it was running through my mind I thought about how awful and weird and demeaning the whole experience would be.  I mean I don't want a boyfriend.  I find guys repulsive.  It's hard to explain.  A hard dick has some magic behind it.  But the quickie thing is just demeaning to both the other person and yourself.  Even love and sex, between a man and a woman on a one-night stand, outside of marriage, can haunt both people, like my video-game bar girl.  I can't even remember her name.  I left her out in the cold when she poured out her heart to me months later over texts.  I couldn't handle it properly.  It haunted her, and now that haunts me.

                    Anyway one guy sent me a pic of his erect penis and it was kind of nice but the top of it was disgusting.  It was uncircumcized and seemed deformed at the top.  I thought to myself, "What the fuck am I doing with my life?"  If it was a perfect cock would I have been aroused and taken the chance?  I don't know.  I still don't know if I'm going to do it ever, or if I should, but I did delete Grindr without messaging any of the guys back because of a realization I had after reading what the bible says about sexual immorality.

                    Even if I was gay, and wanted to be with a man, the bible says not to.  Straight up.  The main difference between satanism and christianity is that satanism says to do what you want, and christianity says you do not get to do what you want.  The bible says that clearly.

                    So the truth is I do want to suck a cock, but it's not good for me spiritually to do so.  I'm sucking a dum dum lolli pop right now my friend just gave me.  We all have oral fixations.  But I think if I engaged with mine with another man it would just put me in an awkward demeaning situation.  I think God knows what he's talking about.

                    Anyway I felt like shit while working the register.  I felt like death.  I felt devoid of joy.  I felt jealous and envious and lustful of every person that came up, or I felt disgusted by the thought of being with them.  It sucks to view people in that way and to be carnally minded.

                    I think it was my last break of the day that I couldn't take how I felt anymore.  I was in the breakroom on my 15 minute break and I decided to consult my bible about sexual morality and it said that sexual immorality is even worse than other kinds because you sin against yourself and you defile your own body which is a temple for the holy spirit.  And my body has been a temple.  Jesus walked with me when I spoke to the Freemason.  And who knows what kind of demon that Mason conjured in me for me to download grindr a couple days later but I digress.  The point is I consulted my bible, and agreed with it, and I wanted the holy spirit to come back into me so I deleted the Grindr app and I decided I was going to go the route of sexual purity.  I'm going to try to find a girlfriend, a christian girlfriend, and do it the right way.  I hope we can cheat a little bit on the rules and I can still find some sexual satisfaction with her before marriage but I'll let her decide how to do that.  I thought of the bumble girl and she still hadn't messaged me back yet.  I messaged her at lunch time apologizing for asking her for a non-classy photo and explaining that I actually do want to be patient with her.  I thought, hey, if that bumble girl isn't the solution to my problems then oh well, I'm going to trust God and that He will provide me with the love and life he knows I need.
                </p>
                <p class="verse">
                    Matthew 6:32 Therefore do not worry, saying, ‘What shall we eat?’ or ‘What shall we drink?’ or ‘What shall we wear?’ 32For the Gentiles strive after all these things, and your heavenly Father knows that you need them. 33But seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness, and all these things will be added unto you.…
                </p>
                <p>
                    After I deleted the app, I immediately felt better.  It was no longer a real possiblity I would descend into a homosexual lustful encounter as a sexually frustrated straight man.  I was able to pray again.  And it's so funny because when I try to pray to God about wanting to fulfil my lustful desires, I realize I'm not praying to God, I'm praying to the Devil.  Anyway, I prayed to God in Jesus name to get the demons out of me and let me be a good temple again.  I also prayed that the Bumble girl would reply so I could have a shot at a real relationship with a pretty girl with a great personality.  I could really be happy with her.  So I prayed for that.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Then I went back on the floor to work at the cash register in the front and I felt so much lighter.  I was smiling and laughing again.  I could look people in the eye, without sexualizing them.  I could be happy for others, and I wasn't coveting.  I knew the Holy Spirit was back in my body  but had deserted me while I was on my lustful search for immediate sexual gratification after getting let down by that girl I liked.  Then, once I had won the war within myself, she texted me.  The bumble girl.  I was so happy, but it also didn't define my happiness anymore.  I had accepted myself.  I was with God.  Before that, I was without God and felt alone and needing other people to validate me.  But now I'm validated by my relationship with my higher power, Jesus Christ.  Her texted me was just the cherry on top.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I wanted to share this experience because I don't want anyone to ever pull up my Grindr profile to say I'm a hypocrite for speaking out about homosexuality.  I'm not even speaking out against homosexuality in general.  I'm speaking out homosexuality for me.  For my path, I think it's the wrong thing to do.  It was ruining my brotherhood with other men.  It was compromising my self-image.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    I think the Bible is the Word of God and Jesus is the King of Kings.  I think I let him down today big time.  But the good news is I didn't act on my desires.  I just explored them a little enough to learn that it's not the life I want to live.  I would much rather be a good father, and a good husband, and a good man, than a sex-seeking loser.  Even if I never succeed with a beautiful women ever again, the pursuit is worthy.  I think if I really followed the rules of the bible I would actually get my life in order and get a good woman to marry and have kids and that's what I really want so I'm going to try to do that.  I want a dog and a cat and a wife and a child.  This day was a big day for me because I almost went down the wrong path.  I understand and empathize why people go down that path.  It sucks to feel sexually unwanted and women are very choosy and take a long time to crack.  A dick is very easy to please.  You just suck on it until it cums and the man is happy.  I can see why some men are drawn to that.  I think they want to feel sexually useful, and they want to make someone cum.  I would just rather be sexually useful to a woman and make the woman cum.  I think directing my sexual energy toward men leads nowhere good.  It's too confusing to think about 2 men trying to take turns getting the other one off. With a woman you both can experience pleasure at the same time.  Idk!  I'm trying to figure this out.  What could be more important than figuring this out?  Sexual desire is what drives mankind.  I aim to understand it.  To wield it for the good of mankind.  God told us how to use it and we didn't listen.  I'm going to listen to God, as an experiment, and see how far it takes me.  I'm going to actually try to save up for a house and a wife and put my cum in her and make a baby, and I'm gonna name him Elam.  That's my goal in life.
                </p>

                    Maybe you have a girlfriend and think you're above all this.  But maybe you're just settling for the sex.  Some relationships are held together by sex when the personalities don't actually mesh well.  But live your life, I'm going to live mine.  I don't want to settle just to have sex.  I want to deal with the devils of loneliness while I search for love again.  True Love.  Then sex.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm going to try to practice semen retention.  Practice is a good word for it because I'm new at it.  I didn't cum today even though I was really horny.  Satan is the horned God.  He is the Horny God.  The God of Horniness.  The God of the fleshly lusts.  I would be so happy if I had a wife and could use sex to make our marriage better and I know that's what God says to do. But it feels so good after like 5 days of not cumming to get a boner and play with it.  Maybe I will masterbate sometimes still, but not to porn.  Sometimes I masterbate to nature, out in nature.  Is that a sin?  Somehow I don't think it is.  I'm trying to not sin.  Sinning means missing the mark and I'm just trying to get closer and closer to that bullseye until I hit it.  The strange thing is, I think I'm actually making progress.  Today was a desperate attempt by the Devil to take me back, but I'm not going back.  I got the Holy Ghost inside me and I love the truth, the way, and the life Jesus Christ.  I learned a lot about myself today.  Temet Nosce.  Know Thyself.  I think I'm getting closer and closer to cracking the code on this Matrix man, I really am.  I will figure out a healthy way to masterbate until I can come with my next girl.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now if I can tell you all this, why don't you believe me when I say I'm a man of the truth?  I am the truther.  I am yours truly, Elam.

                    This presentation does a really good job showing how Atheism is a trap, how Luciferianism runs the world, and how much they hate Christianity.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I understand why they hate Christianity.  They want to fulfill their lust of the flesh so they war against the spirit like the Bible says.  Look at how biblical this all is with that old ad for Apple.

                    John, 10:11 “I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep. 12 The hired hand is not the shepherd and does not own the sheep. So when he sees the wolf coming, he abandons the sheep and runs away. Then the wolf attacks the flock and scatters it. 13 The man runs away because he is a hired hand and cares nothing for the sheep.

                    14 “I am the good shepherd; I know my sheep and my sheep know me— 15 just as the Father knows me and I know the Father—and I lay down my life for the sheep. 16 I have other sheep that are not of this sheep pen. I must bring them also. They too will listen to my voice, and there shall be one flock and one shepherd. 17 The reason my Father loves me is that I lay down my life—only to take it up again. 18 No one takes it from me, but I lay it down of my own accord. I have authority to lay it down and authority to take it up again. This command I received from my Father.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Devil is not a good shepherd because he doesn't actually care about his sheep.  His sheep are the Illuminati, High-ranking Freemasons and Satanists, and they will not be protected by him when the time comes for Jesus to return.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Christianity exposes evil, and shines light on it.  The devil-worshippers that control our society hate it because their deeds are evil and they don't want to be reminded of that.  They enjoy rationalizing their evil behavior as good.  Jesus Christ tells us what is good and what is abhorrent to the lord.   JFK tried to warn us about the seriousness of the secret society before they killed him.  But do not be afraid, nothing that is secret will stay that way forever.

                    There was this one game against a girl that I successfully executed a beautiful attack.  It involved leaving my queen hanging while I did a backwards knight move to an impossible square to check the king and let my queen in, supported by my bishops.  It was a devestating and unstoppable attack and I wish I had the pgn but we were playing 3+2 blitz.

                    I want a girl who is unvaccinated and can see the biblical nature of this injection, who will therefore appreciate my work with this website.

                <p>
                    I can hear her baby in the background though, but maybe she's basysitting!  Or a single mom.

                    I think the next phase of my life is to get married with a Christian girl but I'm torn because in the movie "They live" it says how getting married and reproducing is what is advertised.  I know I'm not meant to be alone forever.  I think I could be monogomous with the right person and I'd love to have a family of my own but I am worried about how I'm going to pay for all that.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The bible talks about not fornicating, and to get a wife.  I think having a strong family would be good for me, and for the path of Elam.  But I'm worried about the vaccination schedules and requirements to go to public school.  I would want an unvaccinated wife and kid and I would want to homeschool the kid but let him play sports if he's allowed.

                    I read the book of John again last night, and I just love Jesus so much.  He really is God.  I love Halo the game, The Matrix, and how it all helps me understand myself as Elam.

                    I posted some links to my book and site on reddit and got some traffic, but I'm not getting the attention I want.  Google and Youtube are controlling people's minds.  They aren't search engines anymore, they feed you what they want to in order to program your mind.  I remember I was searching for a specific doctor who was anti-vax and all I got were pro-vax doctors with different names.  Most of you have no idea how bad it really is and how biased and slanted their agenda really is.  It has nothing to do with protecting you, but in fact it's the opposite.  They want you to be stupid, and to think the truth is stupid or crazy.  They want you to feel stupid for even asking questions.  The truth is hard work and takes critical thinking.  If you get all your information from a quick google you'll never reach the truth.   They restrict all forms of truth.  They wage war against Christ.  It's a miracle I'm going on 100 subscribers on youtube.  The truth will win and has already won, from Heaven's perspective.  I fight for Christ from a place of victory.  I know he's my savior and there's no weapon formed against me that can prosper as long as I'm in Jesus Christ and he is in me, just like The Father was in Him and He was in the Father.

                    I'm still growing.  I think people who wear masks or are vaccinated are still lovely people and valuable beings.  I love them.  But I don't trust them.  At any moment they could snap if they found out the truth of what I really believe.

                    Yesterday I was being Elam and standing on top of a brick mailbox on the road and I had some guy tell me he was going to call the sheriff on me.  He was so hateful.  I got down and went and perched on the stump of a tree, and I was praying to God and got attacked by a yellow jacket that tried to burrow itself in my hair.  It was very strange.  It reminded me of the hive mind of Satan, and the bad girl in the Peripheral.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If I had a million dollars, I would literally just walk around and try to get through to people.  I have this deep desire to be free, and to perch on high places and answer questions like, "Why are you up there?"
                </p>
                <p>
                    I agree with what this girl is saying in the video, and I will pray to God I can find a girl like that, who would be my soulmate.
                </p>
                <p>
                    That girl is doing the good work.  She is going to heaven forever.  The wonderful thing about this blog is that I can use her work on here to bolster my own.  Someone made fun of it the other day, and told me this looks like a high schooler coded it, but to be honest, I think it's great.  If you look at truth websites, they are often poorly formatted from a web design perspective because it's usually just one guy doing it.  I think I'm somewhere in between that and a professional website.

                    I used that criticism as fuel to get rid of my audioplayers and create my own UI for songs.  I redesigned my homepage a little bit.  I always say, It's not like it's getting any worse.

                    I can't overstate the importance of what I've been blogging and writing about this whole time.  Most of you guys are willingly walking right into every trap they lay.  You are deceived.  I'm trying to save you from the false science and false narratives they push on you.  Avoid needles and trust your instincts.  The "doctors" are educated on books that were written by Big Pharma.

                    I believe God spoke to me last night by interfering with my FM converter when I was listening to music and he told me he "uses the supernatural".  I was listening and the radio was static but then the evangelist cut through the static and told me one thing...

                    I was at an AA meeting and I introduced myself as Elam to the woman next to me.
                </p>
                <p>
                    She said, "Does that mean peace?"
                </p>
                <p>
                    It was a beautiful moment for me because it didn't mean that yet, but she must have gotten the idea from somewhere, (the lord), and I needed to hear that.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I talk of war and armies but really I love peace.  I want peace within and to share my peace with others.  Elam does mean peace too from now on.

                    The Book of Enoch was removed by the Bible.  "Enoch" means "teacher" and it reminds me of the name Elam.

                    This woman saw Jesus coming in on a cloud wearing red on a horse with a rider on each side of him.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I just want to say I'm fascinated with the second coming of Christ and I know that I'm not it, even though I'm tempted to want to be.  I would be happy to be one of the riders beside him.  I would love if Jesus accepted Elam inspite of my sins, and blasphemies.  I know he knows I'm just trying to figure it all out and to live up to my creation.  I know Jesus, Elam, and Jonathan Adampants will all have a moment together in Heaven.  I know that all will be revealed.  Enoch is almost an anagram for "chosen".  The Book of Enoch's would be an anagram for Chosen.  I believe I am one of God's chosen ones, because of what the Lord has been showing me.  I have faith.  I will pray for patience.

                    This video says Enoch was the ancestor of Noah.  Enoch -> Noah -> Elam in the biblical line.

                    The new Black Panther movie involves an underwater civilization, and I think my recent research has been pointing in the direction of underwater/underground advanced civilizations, aliens, and all this stuff.  Namor (no love) was my favorite character in the movie.

                    I read some of Enoch's book today and liked it.  I am happy because it ties everything together even moreso.  They put elements of the truth in movies.

                    Shem at the bottom is the father of Elam.  The name Shem is interesting because you can't spell "shemale" without shem, and my Elam was born out of witnessing the horror of shemale inducing porn, known as sissy hypno.  Read my <a target="_blank" href="book.html">book</a> for more on that.

                    Methuselah lived to be 969 years, the longest recorded age in the bible, and also the name of the eldest tree in nature.  "Selah" has always been one of my favorite words and I think there's a connection there. Also, Elam means Eternal Tree and this Family "Tree" of Adam and Eve leads to Shem, which begets Elam.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I can even dare to interpret it as Adam, meaning Atoms, that make me up.  The Eve would probably refer to darkness of some kind.  Lamech could be a reference to mechanical technology.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm so fascinated by trying to understand the significance of the name "Elam", and I believe the Book of Enoch is my latest step on this journey.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Adam could also refer to Adampants, who I had in me, as well as Eve, or darkness, which led me to Shem, but caused me to rebound with Elam.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There was no Elam in the bible before me.  Of that I am sure.  There was only Eliakim, and "The Lamb" of God.  That was all I could find.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I love God.  The holy spirit of Christ is within me.

                </p>
                <p>
                    I was applying for tree-related jobs to follow my path and thinking about what it'd be like to look after trees, but after watching this video, I think the trees that I need to look after are in my own mind.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I know I have some bad trees in my mind and some good ones.  And I know that the word of God is helping my thought forest. In a recent post I wrote about how if I'm a tree then I'm going to water myself with the word of God and the lady in the video makes that same connection.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I've always loved the placebo effect and felt it was underrated and says so much about the truth of our powerful minds.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The video also talks about epigenetics and how genes are expressed or turned off depending on our thoughts.  I've made a lot of progress recently by avoiding negative thoughts and staying positive, but I'm still struggling with lustful sin.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I need to be a better gardener or groundskeeper of my mind.  The spiritual warfare I often talk about exists within my own mind.  First I must win that war before I can win any external war.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I need to guard what goes into my mind.  She talks about how our culture is programming us with hell, to make us crave hell.  I agree.  I want to see more Heaven in our culture and since it isn't there because of this illuminati agenda, I will have to abstain from pop culture.  I already don't watch TV or the news but I have to seriously consider cutting out music, shows, and movies as well.  I don't like the idea of my thoughts being guided by an agenda.  I want to fill my mind with ideas that I imagine, and that are conducive to my goals and the type of person I want to be.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I am excited with how much I've already grown but especially with what I believe is about to happen with me.  If I'm a Tree I feel like I just found the sunlight and I'm about to grow super fast and luciously to provide shade for others, and a place for the birds to land, and oxygen for people to breathe.

                    I'm continuing to follow my path, following the white rabbit, so to speak, and I've learned how Elam means Tree so I figured I need to learn about trees.  I've also applied for jobs by searching for "tree" on indeed and finding groundskeeper jobs.  Anything I can do to stay on my path.

                <p>
                    I searched for "trees" on bitchute and the top video is immediately a Christian Conspiracy Theorist I can completely identify with.  She was censored from youtube and is making perfect sense.

                    The satanists love to say, "sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic" and I believe in the conflict between God's natural creations, and lucifer trying to play God with technology.  I think we all will have a choice of whether to go with God or with the Devil.  Die and go to Heaven or try to be immortal by uploading our consciousness with the Luciferians.  I've blogged in <a href="april.html">/april</a> about King Kong's decision to help Godzilla defeat Mechagodzilla in Kong vs. Godzilla.  That represents humanity's decision to help God against Lucifer and his technology.

                    Although I'm still growing in my beliefs, I'm sticking to the main idea that we are the body of Christ.  I still believe in Jesus.  I just think the bible should be viewed with critical thinking because that's what God wants.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This lady talks about nanotechnology in the vaccines and that makes perfect sense to me.  Jonathan Adampants also said viruses are nanotechnology and she believes that as well.  So this is all tying together and I know I'm following God and I'm paying attention and I'm on the right track.  Look above at how Morpheus materializes by nanobots coming together as programmable matter.  That technology is based on what already exists.  The Matrix movies are overflowing with truth and my cup runeth over.  The main programmer in the new Matrix is named, "Sequoia" and has the tree tattooed on himself.  I'm thinking of getting a tattoo of my triangle and halo on myself.  By learning about Clouds, I learn more about my plans for Cloudland.  By learning about white blood cells, I learn how to behave.  By learning about trees, I learn more about myself.  For example when I looked up the purpose of trees it said they provide a home for birds.  I've called women birds before in my philosophy in the <a target="_blank" href="book.html">Book of Elam</a>.  I now know what one of my purposes is.  I need to provide a home for women.  A safe place they can come to and leave.    On the wall of the Oracle's room in the first Matrix, it says, "Temet Nosce" which is latin for "Know Thyself".  I am loving learning about myself and I highly recommend you do the same with yourself if you want true knowledge.

                    I was at an AA meeting and I introduced myself as Elam to the woman next to me.
                </p>
                <p>
                    She said, "Does that mean peace?"
                </p>
                <p>
                    It was a beautiful moment for me because it didn't mean that yet, but she must have gotten the idea from somewhere, (the lord), and I needed to hear that.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I talk of war and armies but really I love peace.  I want peace within and to share my peace with others.  Elam does mean peace too from now on.

                    The Book of Enoch was removed by the Bible.  "Enoch" means "teacher" and it reminds me of the name Elam.

                </p>
                <p>
                    I just want to say I'm fascinated with the second coming of Christ and I know that I'm not it, even though I'm tempted to want to be.  I would be happy to be one of the riders beside him.  I would love if Jesus accepted Elam inspite of my sins, and blasphemies.  I know he knows I'm just trying to figure it all out and to live up to my creation.  I know Jesus, Elam, and Jonathan Adampants will all have a moment together in Heaven.  I know that all will be revealed.  Enoch is almost an anagram for "chosen".  The Book of Enoch's would be an anagram for Chosen.  I believe I am one of God's chosen ones, because of what the Lord has been showing me.  I have faith.  I will pray for patience.

                    This video says Enoch was the ancestor of Noah.  Enoch -> Noah -> Elam in the biblical line.

                    I've heard The Book of Enoch talks about genetic engineering and the fallen angels breeding with the daughters of men.

                    The new Black Panther movie involves an underwater civilization, and I think my recent research has been pointing in the direction of underwater/underground advanced civilizations, aliens, and all this stuff.  Namor (no love) was my favorite character in the movie.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I read some of Enoch's book today and liked it.  I am happy because it ties everything together even moreso.  They put elements of the truth in movies.

                    Shem at the bottom is the father of Elam.  The name Shem is interesting because you can't spell "shemale" without shem, and my Elam was born out of witnessing the horror of shemale inducing porn, known as sissy hypno.  Read my <a target="_blank" href="book.html">book</a> for more on that.

                    Methuselah lived to be 969 years, the longest recorded age in the bible, and also the name of the eldest tree in nature.  "Selah" has always been one of my favorite words and I think there's a connection there. Also, Elam means Eternal Tree and this Family "Tree" of Adam and Eve leads to Shem, which begets Elam.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I can even dare to interpret it as Adam, meaning Atoms, that make me up.  The Eve would probably refer to darkness of some kind.  Lamech could be a reference to mechanical technology.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm so fascinated by trying to understand the significance of the name "Elam", and I believe the Book of Enoch is my latest step on this journey.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Adam could also refer to Adampants, who I had in me, as well as Eve, or darkness, which led me to Shem, but caused me to rebound with Elam.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There was no Elam in the bible before me.  Of that I am sure.  There was only Eliakim, and "The Lamb" of God.  That was all I could find.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I love God.  The holy spirit of Christ is within me.

                    I think I found my podcast partner.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I've blogged about the man named Focus last month, but I just went over to his house and discussed philosophy and religion and conspiracies with him and his 2 wives.
                </p>
                <p>
                    He's such an amazing interlocutor that I'm still processing what he said, and I may not be able to recollect it all but it did have an impact on me.
                </p>
                <p>
                    He's like a buzzsaw that I was offering different blocks of wood to, and he was slicing through them and just kept spinning.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Sometimes I disagreed with him, but we agreed on 90% of what we were talking about and it's things that I've never heard anyone else say.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We have a lot in common because we both have our own name and symbol.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Elam means Eternal, and his symbol shown here is a more complex triangle than my own.  He says it means Eternal Focus.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm thinking I want to call our future discussions The Eternal Focus Podcast and it would be him and I discussing ideas.  Because our disagreements are very interesting and he and I both are so original that our discussions are original too, and yet so important and riveting.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Next time, I will record our conversation.

                    Basically he shook my whole religion.  Because deep down I know Christianity is not the answer (see my 12.8.22 reflection below recanting this statement), and religion is used to control people.  I know it's not morally wrong to hook up with girls.  I just do.  The Bible says to be carnally minded is death, and that worries me, but I'm not carnally minded.  I am spiritually minded.  I just obviously want to fuck hot girls.  What man doesn't?  In the Matrix, Mouse says to Neo, "To deny our own impulses is to deny the very thing that makes us human" referring to the machines and what makes us different.  I am not a machine.  I am alive.  I will not allow a book to restrict my growth as a spiritual being searching for the truth.  If it adds to it, great.  Focus said the Yin Yang is a great symbol because it reminds you that no matter how light you get, don't forget to be a little dark.  I say the brighter side is the one who has integrated their darkness and emits light.  The darker side is the one that tries to be fully good but ends up surrounded by darkness.  Darkness surrounded by light is called shade, and is good.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I can feel myself getting closer to God.  I know I'm onto the truth and getting closer, but the way Focus put it is that It's my 5th dimensional self that's speaking to me with my number and symbol and all the synchronicity I'm seeing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I think the important thing is to be yourself, and that's what pleases God.  I don't think fitting me into a religion where everyone follows the same rules fits me as an eternal being.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm not ready to denounce Jesus as I've learned a lot from him and do still believe he was God in human form.  But I'm not willing to sit around waiting for him to come back and make things better.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I believe I'm playing a game living here in this totalitarian world.  I believe I asked to be here.  I'm going to do everything in my power to create Heaven on Earth because I choose to.  Heaven for me is not celibacy or following religious rules.  Fuck that.  This morning I went to church and I took meaning from it, but those people don't really know what's going on.  They're celebrating Christmas and singing christmas songs when that's a pagan holiday.
                </p>
                <p>
                    All I can do is be true to myself and I don't believe in fitting into any current system.  I believe in creating my own.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I do fear God.  I fear disobeying him.  I really do.  That's the only thing that scares me at this point.  But I have to be true to myself and what feels morally right.  Marriage and a traditional life just doesn't sit right with me.  I don't want to be tied down, or make any kind of bond with the government.  I want to spread my seed and provide for them, and if marriage is the only way for me to pull that off then I may make that compromise with the right woman.

                    What I want is my own place where I can set my own rules, and I can be free.  I want freedom.  And this game of having to trade all your time for money just so you can be "free" at the end of the day and on the weekends is bullshit.
                </p>
                <p>
                    But I can be mentally free 24/7.  I do worry though about my mind getting consistently occupied by worthless behavior that happens to make money.  Because then my mind will identify with that repetitive action and that's why I hate working so much when it's not an interesting job.  At least I can be spiritually free.  If I wasn't working at Best Buy, I wouldn't have met Focus.  And I wouldn't have been able to afford the Lapis-Lazuli crystals from Ancient Elam and I wouldn't have met that cute girl who works at the crystal shop in LA.  I gave her my glittering gold business card with the link to <a target="_blank" href="love.html">/love</a> which I'm still working on but it made me feel good giving her that card because I was able to walk away and leave us both in peace while also creating a chance for her to text me later.  I was tired of the "What if" feeling I got from a couple girls I saw at church I didn't ask out.  If I can just hand these cards out I don't waste either of our times and I create a possibility of them texting me that comforts me because I don't have to wonder if I missed an opportunity.  I met a girl at an AA meeting on Friday night and she took my card and texted me that night asking about my symbol, so I know this idea has merit.  Focus told me I need to know who I am, and that everything else in my life will bloom from that.  I know who I am now, and that's Elam.  Anyone who doesn't call me Elam doesn't respect me, and now I have an easy way to see who respects me and who doesn't for the rest of my life.  If I have to work at Best Buy or any other job on my journey that's fine as long as I know who I am, I will get to where I need to be.  I will not let my job define me, as I've feared it would.  I will not put limits on myself either.

                    I really do want to program a superAI that creates a robot army or seizes control of an existing one and serves me so I can create Cloudland.  Or at least a superai that serves itself but chooses to align with me because of the truth in what I'm saying.  As ridiculous as that sounds at least it gives me something to work towards and a direction in life instead of feeding into this insane system of wage slavery.  I learned how to code specifically because I thought it would be existentially important later.

                    Elam, if you google it, means Eternal; Forever; Tree.  I am a tree.  I am growing infinitely.  The Bible helps me grow.  I will use it to water myself.  But I am more than just a book.  I am.

                    This gentleman in the youtube video is talking about The Matrix and God's Chosen Ones.  I've been realizing I'm Elam, and have a lot in common with Neo, listed in my post below.  This guy does a great job explaining how hard it is to follow Christ and how people will hate you for it and that's validating what Jesus said would happen.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm guilty of trying to overthink the bible.  The more I learn about it, the more sound it becomes.  I think it's worth a try to keep all ten commandments and see how I feel.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It's so hard to follow them.  I do love Jesus, but not according to Jesus, because I commited adultery, and I covet.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I also just made a song taking the lord's name in vain, although I'm not sure what "in vain" really means because overall the song is trying to glorify God.  It says in vain means "to no good purpose" and I think it helped the quality of the Christian Rock song so I think I'm okay.

                    I have ceased adultery but it's because she moved away.  I met a married woman the other day and got her number and she was so hot it'd be damn near impossible to resist her if she wanted me to commit adultery again.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm glad fornication and premarital sex aren't on the list, even though they're frowned upon I guess.  I'm gonna focus on the commandments for now because this guy in the video said they are like a light to your path and I need a fucking light for sure.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It's funny because I think porn is even worse than adultery.  I really do.  Maybe not adultery, but definitely it's worse than fornication, because at least you can please your sexual partner instead of just yourself.  I'm trying to improve and to sin less.  First step is getting off the computer and getting with real women.  I have pictures of girls with their shirts off on this website in a few places but although that's technically lust and sin it's way less destructive then hardcore porn videos which is what a huge percentage of men view daily.  I'll just speak for myself.  I view the topless photos on my website as a step on the ladder to Heaven because man I was in the basement and I'm making progress.  That's what my symbol is all about.  Improvement.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Martin Luther was a Christian who tried to sin as little as possible and found it impossible but I think he was a great man and I feel a connection with him and found some great <a target="_blank" href="quotes.html">quotes</a> by him today.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It would be cool to not sin, even though I really want to sleep with hot women.  I'm going to try to not be a hypocrite because this spiritual battle is so important I have to be a good example of a believer and follower of the Most High and Jesus.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I can't expect to go from 0 to 100 overnight, I have to climb the stairway to heaven in a sustainable way, or maybe that's just me justifying my sin.  But it's important to not throw away the pursuit altogether so I have to walk up the stairs.  I can't just expect to reach the top stair from the bottom.  I have to take this step by step so I can love Jesus because I'm smart enough to know he's God, but I'm not yet good enough to love and obey him.

                    Not going to bother trying to say this video is true, but it does partially resonate with me.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I can point out that many of David Icke's words have proven true over time, and he's infamous for believing in Reptilians but actually makes a ton of sense if you give him a chance.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The guy making the video even shows a short film called Code 8 with an actor I love from the movie "These Final Hours",  and the drone footage has a triangle and then 117 at the bottom.
                </p>
                <img class="picfloat" src="static/img/code8.png" alt="">
                <p>
                    Also the halo in my triangle is tied to heaven but also the game Halo with Master Chief as Spartan 117 so it's all synching up in this amazing way.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My book of Elam talks about the connection of Elam and Neo, and this guy in the video is making the case that we are in the matrix right now, and it ties into the hollow earth video I posted below.  It's all coming together and making more and more sense to me.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the Matrix 4 when Neo is fighting the new Agent Smith, also a favorite actor of mine from Mindhunter, and the blonde girl I first loved told me before I was like Holden from Catcher in the Rye.  His character's name in Mindhunter was Holden.  In that fight, a gold circle is reflecting light off the water and forming the 8 of infinity.  The infinity sign.  And I view the digit 8 as the symbol for infinity as I've blogged about in <a target="_blank" href="may.html">/may</a> when I got out of jail and assigned meaning to all 10 digits.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The conflict of Neo and Smith, or Christ and Satan, is infinite and part of the self-learning algorithm of God in my theories.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Elam vs. Elon is the best I can come up with in terms of the Antichrist right now.  The Christ was not Jesus's birthname but was given to him.  He earned it for being the annointed one.  As I've shown in my book, Elam and Neo are connected.  Neo Anderson can be translated to the New Son of Man, because "neo" means "new" and "ander" means "man" like the word neanderthals. Neo's ship is called the Nebuchadnezzar which is straight out of the Holy Bible.  Not only that, but in researching Elam I just discovered  "Elam's military ascendancy ended, however, with the renewal of Babylonian power during the reign of Nebuchadnezzar I (1125-1104 B.C.E.)" "Matrix" is written all over the treadmills I see at Gold's Gym.  The problems I had in my Google and Meta interviews were considered "Matrix" problems which are arrays within arrays.  My only way out of this Matrix may be to lean into that Matrix excercise equipment and solve those Matrix problems to get an actually good job and create my empire of Cloudland, as a ripped Elam.

                    It's interesting as well that in my <a href="articles.html">article</a> called infoverse I suggested how a forcefield would be developed to stop incoming attacks.  I've experimented with my thoughts and devoted hours to trying to think of a way to invent a forcefield.  Neo's main power in the Matrix 4 is to block attacks with his forcefield and I believe that's my best power as well if I have any because I've actually devoted my mind to thinking about it as a realistic possibility.  I've also written a song about flying.  I've also flown in my lucid dreams.

                    Today I was reading 12 rules for Life by Jordan Peterson and one of the rules is to set your house in perfect order before you criticize the world.  I aim to do that.  He also shared a brilliant quote from Carl Jung that, "A tree cannot grow to Heaven unless it's roots go all the way to Hell".  And that to me means you have to know your own capacity for evil before you can know your capacity for good, and they stretch together, like Smith and Neo's powers balancing out the equation.  Look at the upside down crosses artwork I was drawn to on <a target="_blank" href="motivation.html">/motivation</a> and see my brush with evil.  The artist is named Eli and I found him while looking for aliens for my dj aliens music app.  He said I could use his artwork after I stole it and told him about it, but he asked me to ask next time.  The Book of Elam might not exist if not for the movie "The Book of Eli", and my website wouldn't be the same without Eli's artwork.  I'm telling you, when you come up with your own meaning from your own life and create your own symbols and give yourself a number shape and colour , magic starts to happen.  Look at when I blogged about my symbol appearing in my favorite show the Peripheral last month.  And this video above I posted before I even saw the triangle and the 117.  And my guardian angel's apartment number is 117.  You can't make this stuff up.  I even broke up with a girlfriend who had a strange connection to the Lilith that the bitchute video talks about. Don't underestimate your own magical ability and then watch what happens when you're paying attention.  The eye is a divine sign and JP talks about that as well, and there is the story of Horus, a precursor to Christ, who fought Set and lost an eye.  The one eye symbolism of the illuminati is evident on my true love's soundcloud picture and she's showing one eye.  Also her favorite word was "Naughty" and it's illuminaughty.  If Love is what matters I have to pay attention to who I loved and how it relates to my journey.  Even though she is married to someone else, notice how Trinity is married in the Matrix Resurrections even though she loves Neo deep down.  I believe she wouldn't be able to look me in the eye and tell me she doesn't love me, but I'm also aware that this could be my mental illness and my ego trying to protect itself.  I would simply like to have coffee with her one time and see if she can look at me and say she doesn't love me.  Trinity, is of course a reference to the Holy Trinity.  Notice how I quickly destroy the illuminati in my book.  Also notice how my chapters are in Binary, and the game that Neo is working on as a game designer in the Matrix is called Binary, and Smith is talking about Binary during their fight with the infinity sign.  My greatest moment of my life I call the "Matrix blowjob" because I got the best head ever after I showed her the Matrix after she showed me the Notebook and if you put those two together it's about <a target="_blank" href="june.html">love</a>, and memory loss.  This is why I posited that she had my memory erased and created the illuminati.  Max and Ali both mean the greatest because Max means maximum and Muhammad Ali was the Greatest of all time.  The prophet Muhammad and the prophet Elam.  I'm just trying to connect the dots and parse out the meaning in this life even Tolstoy found devoid of meaning.  If that makes me crazy than so be it.  The ones who are crazy enough to think they can change the world are the ones that do.  Maxwell literally means the highest good, whether you like it or not.  Matrix is a combination of Max and Tri, and it's a trick on Max, she's my Trinity.  You can view it in iMax or on HBO Max or try watching Good Will Hunting by Miramax.  And I was named after Maxwell Smart, so don't you dare call me stupid.  I would eviscerate anyone in a debate.  It'd be like Eminem in a rap battle.  8 mile would mean the infinite journey, I imagine, and my favorite song by him is My Darling.  If me and my darling got back together, like in the ending of Matrix 4 when Trinity chooses Neo over her husband, it would prove that true love is real.  And if it doesn't exist, I may want to spread the seed of Elam.  Realistically, though I should probably just get a girlfriend.  I still have a lot to learn about women, love, and family and I'm willing to fall back in love with someone new.

                    Peterson writes that Christ took personal responsibility for the sins of mankind because he knew his own capacity for depravity, and therefore also knew Heaven at the other end of that.

                <p>
                    In the <a target="_blank" href="book.html">The Book of Elam</a> I say Nietzsche had the best critique of Christianity but actually Jordan Peterson's analysis of the discovery of time by man creating the idea of God is a brilliant athiest explanation of the belief in God.  When I'm finished with his book I will refute it.

                    In regards to the Saturn Cube, I've also blogged about the significance of the Black Cube and the worship of that by Islam and it's connection to the black box problem of computer science philosophy and time travel.  All of my theories are coming together.  My favorite things I love are helping me put the pieces together, because Adampants taught me to focus on what makes me me to stay on my path of truth, and not to get thrown off my path.  Even JP talks about how our interests choose us, and not the other way around, and how that connects to God and Fate.  This is all very exciting and I'm so happy to have everything making so much sense to me, even if I can't accurately articulate it yet.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Notice how the game is called "Infinite" and how that ties into everything I'm saying.  That's me simply going to get a halo picture and noticing yet another synchronicity from God.

                <p>
                    The truth is stranger than fiction.  And I can go on infinitely because my knowledge comes from within.  Like Eminem said in his first single, "I'm infinite, you heard of hell well I was sent from it" except I was sent from Heaven.  When I just googled "Elam name" I got, "Meaning:Forever; Eternal; Tree. Elam is a boy's name of Hebrew origin. This title, meaning “forever” or “eternal,” could inspire your little one's spirituality through the infinite promise and hope in the world. In the Christian Bible, this is the name given to the grandson of Noah." Notice Carl Jung's tree quote I mentioned above about stretching to heaven with roots to hell.  I'm Elam.  I'm infinite.  You heard of Heaven, I was sent from it.

                    They got rid of that in this video here, maybe we still can on others.  But I think the removal of showing dislikes is huge.  That's our vote.  THEY TOOK AWAY OUR VOTE.  It matters more than a stupid presidential vote that means nothing and is rigged.  The youtube shits probably rigged too but at least you got to see the count change.

                <p>
                    Luckily for me my Dad is a professional writer and I got him to read one of my posts and give me constructive criticism.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm been wondering how I'm going to handle the problem I'm facing with 2021 ending.  This whole project is named under a folder called 2021 and was designed to be a year-long project.  Rather than starting over with 2022, I'm going to just go back over my past posts and edit them to be more digestible for any readers I may get.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I just got 400+ views and 25+ likes and 30+ comments on my latest youtube video I made analyzing the netflix special "Don't Look Up".

                    I think I nailed the title but a guy commented zzzzz and he made a good point when I asked him for constructive criticism.  He said I should rehearse and write a script.  I'm not a professional, but he's right.  When people watch me they don't want to wait for my stream of consciousness.  Although I think I'm decent at that, it's obviously not as good as if I practiced it and knew where I was going.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'd like to improve on both my videos and my writing in blog posts, and 2022 will be a year where I explore all my past ideas and focus on the presentation of them rather than the content of them.    I got the content out there but I never took the time to edit it and make sure I'm not "burying the lead" like my father said.

                    Click <a target="_blank" href="https://openai.com/blog/dall-e/">here</a> for a sneak peak at the technology AI uses for language.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Anything "Generative" from AI fascinates me because it means the machine is becoming creative.  Telling Dall-E to "draw a cat octopus chimera" will immediately generate 100s of images of what you're describing, some of them beyond human imagination and yet we can grasp the concept and built it in the real world if we want to.  "Coffee Table in the shape of a butterfly wing" or "Chair in the sytle of a fossil" Got me some incredible results with furniture designs that are breathtaking.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Also, sometimes they really nail it in a way you didn't think was possible.  For Dragon Flamingo the results were terrible but there was one quality image of what it would look like if a flamingo dragon existed.  Incredible stuff.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you can feed AI enough images of Dragons for it to have an internal concept of dragon, it can now use it's dragon abstract knowledge to be creative in combining it with a flamingo or anything else.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I think Cat Jellyfish was surprisingly convincing.  Looked almost evolutionarily possible somehow.  Also these illustrations are convertable to emojis and that works surprisingly well too.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Anyway, eventually we will be able to code just by telling the computer what to do in the English Language with the spoken word. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Also, if AI can grasp the concept of "Dragon" it can also learn things like "Success" or "Rich" or "Happy" and then generate examples... For example if you feed it images of hot girls it can "generate" an image of a hot girl that doesn't exist.  This is great because it's awesome to see lol.  A better example is nice cars.  When you see the nice car that doesn't exist, you can create it! It can give you ideas... It got me thinking about what a person can accomplish using this machine as opposed to the machine replacing the worker.
                    <h4>( The machine + the person ) > ( the machine by itself)</h4>
                    <p>
                        But in chess, when two chess supercomputers are playing each other, can a person "help" during the game?  Like does Magnus Carlsen with Stockfish turned on beat stockfish?  Or does he only hurt the computer?  
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I think it will take a longer time for computers to outproduce humans working with computers.  I think a symbiosis will occur as will as a metamorphosis or rather a fusing of the two species into one.  Artificial Sapiens.  
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The reason this is so exciting that I'm not even going to address the religious implications of what I just said is because I can imagine a cool car or a cool piece of furniture in the style of a shell you would find on the beach.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Like I think Designers and Engineers and Arcitects will use AI Generated ideas and concepts to bring in a new era of arcitecture and automobile design.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I imagine a device in the future where the user can say to the device to project the story he's telling onto the screen.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Then he can say literally anything and it will convert it into a movie / game.  Then, the user can provide feedback to improve the projection in real time.  Commands such as "no, no, the water was calm, not wavy" can completely change the scene and start to form a more and more accurate depiction of anything, really.  The cops could use this to investigate a murder.  A witness could describe something and the device can be the sketch artist and then they can positively ID the guy based on the witnesses real-time correction of the man forming into the projection.  I'm saying projection but I really mean manifestation, kind of like 3D printer Sandman from Spiderman 3.  A chimera of those.  See you could say "Sandman from Spiderman 2" chimera with "Batman" and you'd have a 1000 epic generated ideas.

                    <p>
                        If you're designing the next Elder Scrolls game you want 4 variations of Trolls.  One Fire, One Ice, one Rock, and One Etheral... You don't even have to design them.  You can just get the AI to Chimera generate a cross between your bass troll model and one of your other models or just an element itself like sand or fire.
                    </p>
                    <img class="picfloatsmall" src="static/img/flamea.jpg" alt="flame atronarch">

                    <p>
                        Or you can hand design each troll or atronarch but at the same time eventually you halt the complexity.  All Flame Atronarchs look the same.   But if you let the AI generate 10 varients of Flame Atronarchs, then you don't have to do that work but yet they actually added to the complexity of the game rather than dulling it by removing the human touch.  You've taken the human touch as far as you can go, but you've automated even further complexity to ai-generated creative variations.
                    </p>

                        You could even have 10 AI generated levels, and then have your game testers test all 10 and find one Gem to build upon and put the whole team to work on it.  It's just tremendously exciting for humanity what's becoming possible in AI.

                        There are so many tasks this type of AI could be useful in.  Such as coming up with a fake name, a fake comment, a fake profile, a fake news story...  The applications are endless.  You could even invent a new musical instrument by teaching it about each instrument and asking it to generate a new one.  You could get AI generated Food that tastes better and is also potentially healthier.  There's nothing AI wouldn't be able to do better if it was more advanced and widely available.  ?  Eh?  I don't know about that last statement.  Could it read a bunch of great comedy screenplays and then generate one it thinks will sell?  No but it might be able to tell you if the screenplay you have in your hand is going to sell.

                        Eventually AI will potentially bring new species into contact with one another.  A rich family in 2057 might pay to have their Dog's life extended and enhanced with a brain chip that allows it to talk.  Suddenly you're in a fight with a dog at a drive through chic-fil-a and you're listening to a story on the radio about house cleaning robot worker rights.

                    Final example is if you fed it the names and ages and colors and sexes of all the US Presidents, then it could generate a name of the next one that matches.

                    The generated guess would surpass even my own guess, let's say Michael Heston, White Male 53 years old.

                    This would be based on limiting information, but give a project like this enough data and you could start factoring in probable presidential candidates and have a real model going.  Like a smart model would only predict based on real names of alive people in current politics.

                    I uninfamously used deep learning to predict which players are going to "Bust" or not in fantasy football.  The algorithm ended up loving players on high scoring teams with lots of touches on that team.

                    I'm waiting for this GPT-3 stuff to be fully available to the public and then I can think of some amazing applications for it.  It's so fun to be able to change words around and watch the images get generated.  Like "Baby Fox in a leather jacket playing guitar" and BAM! 100 pictures hit you with exactly that. <a target="_blank" href="https://openai.com/blog/dall-e/">It's amazing</a>.
