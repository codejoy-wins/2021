                <h2>Martin Luther Quotes</h2>
                <p>
                    "To be a Christian without prayer is no more possible than to be alive without breathing."
"You are not only responsible for what you say but also for what you do not say."
"Peace if possible; truth at all costs."
"You should not believe your conscience and your feelings more than the Word which the Lord Who receives sinners preaches to you."
"We need to hear the Gospel every day because we forget it every day."
"Lord Jesus, You are my righteousness; I am Your sin. You took on You what was mine, yet set on me what was Yours. You became what You were not, that I might become what I was not."
"The Bible is a remarkable fountain: The more one draws and drinks of it, the more it stimulates thirst."
"We do not become righteous by doing righteous deeds but, having been made righteous, we do righteous deeds."
"The truth of the matter is rather as Christ says, 'He who is not with me is against me.' He does not say, 'He who is not with me is not against me either, but merely neutral.'"
"The gospel cannot be truly preached without offense and tumult."

                <p>
                    I love you.
                </p>
